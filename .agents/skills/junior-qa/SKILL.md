description: Validate Junior changes through local app-facing paths. Use for local client or agent QA, dashboard mock reporting UI QA, PR readiness, plugin CLI commands, skill/tool/prompt/plugin behavior, and behavior that tests do not cover well but can be exercised with `pnpm cli -- chat ...`, `pnpm cli -- <command> ...`, or `JUNIOR_DASHBOARD_MOCK_CONVERSATIONS=true pnpm dev`.
---

Use the local Junior CLI to exercise behavior the test suite does not prove well.
The goal is to run the same app-facing path a developer or operator would use
from `apps/example`, inspect the result, and report concrete evidence.

Start by reading `specs/local-agent.md`. Read the relevant feature spec too when
the changed behavior is owned by one.

## Running the Local CLI

Use the repo wrapper so the command runs from `apps/example` with root and app
env loaded:

```sh
pnpm cli -- chat -p "Say exactly: junior qa smoke ok"
```

For agent behavior, prompts, skills, tools, and model-facing plugin behavior,
use `chat -p` or interactive `chat` with a prompt that naturally exercises the
change:

```sh
pnpm cli -- chat -p "<targeted prompt>"
```

For host or plugin CLI behavior, call the command directly through the same
wrapper:

```sh
pnpm cli -- memory search --scope personal --scope-key local:local-cli --limit 5
```

Use example app discovery probes when the change touches skill or plugin
discovery:

```sh
pnpm cli -- chat -p "/example-local confirm local QA discovery"
pnpm cli -- chat -p "/example-bundle-help"
```

Healthy startup usually logs `SOUL.md`, `WORLD.md`, loaded plugins, and
discovered skills. Treat those logs as useful evidence that the example app path
was exercised.

## Dashboard UI QA

For dashboard UI changes that depend on reporting payload shape, use the typed
mock reporting overlay before relying on ad-hoc local conversations:

```sh
JUNIOR_DASHBOARD_MOCK_CONVERSATIONS=true pnpm dev
```

Then open the dashboard in a browser and exercise the relevant conversation,
transcript, search, or conversation stats surface. The mock overlay returns
read-only `@sentry/junior/reporting` conversation API-shaped data, including
dashboard QA edge cases such as activity-only tool rows and inverted tool
timestamps. It also includes an advisor tool call/result paired with advisor
subagent activity so transcript rendering can be checked against nested tool
activity without manufacturing a live agent run. Use it when a UI change needs
deterministic reporting records that are hard to produce through a live local
chat. Plugin report data is pass-through from the configured reporting provider
and needs separate validation.

Do not treat mock dashboard data as proof of runtime ingestion, Slack delivery,
credential behavior, or model behavior. Pair it with local CLI or integration
tests when the changed contract crosses those boundaries.

## Choosing a Probe

Pick the smallest local CLI run that demonstrates the changed behavior:

- Use exact-output prompts for simple agent routing or prompt-context checks.
- Use natural-language prompts when the behavior is an agent/tool workflow.
- Use direct plugin commands when the behavior is an operator CLI surface.
- Use interactive `pnpm cli -- chat` when continuity across turns matters.
- Use dashboard mock reporting when the behavior is dashboard rendering,
  filtering, search, or metrics over reporting API payloads.
- Do not use local CLI to claim Slack-only behavior, such as Slack formatting,
  delivery retries, reactions, files, or OAuth UI.

Automated tests, typechecks, linters, and evals are separate validation. They do
not replace local QA evidence from running the client or agent.

## Failure Handling

If local chat fails because credentials are missing or expired, refresh the
environment when appropriate with `pnpm dev:env`, then rerun the same command.
If Redis errors appear during ordinary local QA, check whether
`JUNIOR_STATE_ADAPTER=redis` was set; local chat normally defaults to memory
state.

If the model answer is too loose to prove the behavior, use a narrower prompt,
an exact-output prompt, interactive mode, or a direct plugin CLI command. If the
behavior cannot be exercised through the local client/agent, say local QA is
insufficient and name the runtime surface that still needs manual coverage.

## Reporting

Report:

- the exact `pnpm cli -- ...` commands run
- for dashboard mock QA, the dev-server command, URL, mock conversation or page
  inspected, and the visible UI evidence
- exit status and the key output that proves the behavior
- whether `apps/example` loaded the expected app/plugin/skill path
- whether local QA was sufficient, or what remains unproven locally

Keep any automated test/lint/typecheck/eval results in a separate validation
section so they are not confused with local QA.
