Use `junior init` when you want a new project to start from the supported runtime shape instead of wiring Junior by hand.

## Usage

```bash
pnpm dlx @sentry/junior init my-bot
```

The command requires exactly one argument: the target directory.

## What it creates

The scaffold includes:

- `package.json` with `@sentry/junior`, `@sentry/junior-maintenance`, `hono`, `nitro`, `vite`, `typescript`, and `jiti`
- `plugins.ts` with `@sentry/junior-maintenance` enabled
- `server.ts`
- `nitro.config.ts` pointing at `./plugins`
- `vite.config.ts`
- `vercel.json`
- `app/SOUL.md`
- `app/WORLD.md`
- `app/DESCRIPTION.md`
- `app/skills/`
- `app/plugins/`
- `.env.example`
- `.gitignore`

`SOUL.md` sets Junior's default voice, `WORLD.md` holds operational context, and `DESCRIPTION.md` powers the user-facing app description. Add other `app/*.md` files only when you want optional reference material available to the agent at runtime. `ABOUT.md` is not part of the scaffold and is not supported.

The generated `plugins.ts` enables `@sentry/junior-maintenance` by default, which provides the `self-update` skill for keeping Junior packages current. It is also the place to add other packaged plugins later.

This gives you the supported app shape needed to run Junior locally, keep the app updated, and continue with plugin or skill setup.

## Example output

After a successful run, the CLI prints the created path and the next command to run:

```text
Created my-bot at /path/to/my-bot

  cd my-bot && pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

## Constraints

`junior init` is strict about the target path:

- The path must be a directory, not a file
- The directory must be empty if it already exists
- Extra arguments are rejected

If validation fails, the CLI exits non-zero and prints an error such as:

```text
junior command failed: refusing to initialize non-empty directory: /path/to/my-bot
```

## Verification

After scaffolding:

1. Run `cd my-bot && pnpm install`.
2. Fill in the required values from `.env.example`.
3. Run `pnpm dev`.
4. Check `http://localhost:3000/health`.

For the complete setup flow, continue with [Quickstart](/start-here/quickstart/).

## Next step

Follow [Quickstart](/start-here/quickstart/) to add env vars, then run [junior check](/cli/check/) once you start adding skills or plugins.
