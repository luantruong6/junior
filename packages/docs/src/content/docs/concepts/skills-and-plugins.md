## Mental model

Skills tell Junior how to behave. Plugins tell Junior what external capability
surface and credential sources may exist.

- Skills define focused instruction bundles.
- Plugins declare optional capabilities, optional credentials, and optional skills.
- Runtime selects and executes skills based on task context. Registered plugin provider declarations constrain credential access.
- Plugins own runtime setup. If a skill needs a CLI, system package, MCP server, OAuth provider, or token delivery path, that requirement belongs in the plugin manifest instead of the skill prose.

## Skill sources

- Local skills: `app/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Plugin skills: shipped in installed plugin packages

## Capability gating

Credentials are not ambient. When sandbox traffic reaches a registered
provider's declared domain, the runtime fetches a credential for the current
requester and turn, then injects it automatically. If no registered provider
owns the destination domain, the request is not given provider auth.

## Validation

```bash
pnpm skills:check
```

Move package installs, CLI bootstraps, MCP server setup, and API-key configuration to `plugin.yaml` so reviewed manifests, not arbitrary skill instructions, control the runtime authority surface.

## Next step

- [Plugins](/extend/)
