## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24
- pnpm
- Vercel CLI
- Slack app credentials
- Redis configured for development

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

```bash
pnpm dlx vercel@latest login
pnpm dlx vercel@latest switch
pnpm dlx vercel@latest link --yes
pnpm dlx vercel@latest env pull .env --environment=development
```

If your team account requires an explicit Vercel scope, add `--scope <team-slug>` to the `link` and `env pull` commands.

## Run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This starts the example app on `http://localhost:3000` by default. It also rebuilds and watches the workspace packages that the example app consumes, so dashboard and runtime package edits are reflected without manually rebuilding first.

For dashboard visual QA without generating real Slack traffic, overlay sample conversations:

```bash
JUNIOR_DASHBOARD_MOCK_CONVERSATIONS=true pnpm dev
```

The fixtures are read-only dashboard data and appear before any real local conversation sessions.

## Common checks

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm skills:check
pnpm docs:check
```

## Slack tunnel

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

Set Event Subscriptions and Interactivity URL to:

```text
https://<tunnel-host>/api/webhooks/slack
```

## Next step

Run focused checks from [Testing](/contribute/testing/), then verify behavior in [Verify & Troubleshoot](/start-here/verify-and-troubleshoot/).
