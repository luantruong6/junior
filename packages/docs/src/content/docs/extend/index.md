Junior plugins are manifest-owned provider integrations. A plugin package can also ship skills that use that provider surface, but skills do not define plugin config, credentials, domains, OAuth scopes, MCP endpoints, or runtime dependencies.

## Where plugins live

A declarative plugin declares:

- A manifest (`plugin.yaml`) that declares optional capabilities, optional config keys, and optional credential behavior.
- Optional skills (`SKILL.md`) that consume those capabilities at runtime.

For app-specific workflows, define plugins directly in your app:

```text
app/plugins/<plugin-name>/
├── plugin.yaml
└── skills/
    └── <skill-name>/
        └── SKILL.md
```

Use this when you want fast iteration inside a single app without publishing packages.

For shared manifest-only integrations, publish the same shape as an npm
package:

```text
my-junior-plugin/
├── package.json
├── plugin.yaml
└── skills/
    └── <skill-name>/
        └── SKILL.md
```

## How to add packaged plugins

For reuse across apps or teams, package plugin manifests and any bundled skills as npm packages and install them next to `@sentry/junior`.

```bash
pnpm add @sentry/junior @sentry/junior-agent-browser @sentry/junior-datadog @sentry/junior-github @sentry/junior-hex @sentry/junior-linear @sentry/junior-maintenance @sentry/junior-notion @sentry/junior-scheduler @sentry/junior-sentry @sentry/junior-vercel
```

Create one runtime-safe plugin set and point `juniorNitro()` at that module.
Manifest-only packages use package-name strings. Plugins that need runtime
hooks use JavaScript factories such as `githubPlugin()` and `schedulerPlugin()`.
`createApp()` reads the same enabled plugin set from Nitro's virtual module at
runtime.

```ts title="plugins.ts"
import { defineJuniorPlugins } from "@sentry/junior";
import { githubPlugin } from "@sentry/junior-github";
import { schedulerPlugin } from "@sentry/junior-scheduler";

export const plugins = defineJuniorPlugins([
  "@sentry/junior-agent-browser",
  "@sentry/junior-datadog",
  githubPlugin({
    botNameEnv: "GITHUB_APP_BOT_NAME",
    botEmailEnv: "GITHUB_APP_BOT_EMAIL",
  }),
  "@sentry/junior-hex",
  "@sentry/junior-linear",
  "@sentry/junior-maintenance",
  "@sentry/junior-notion",
  schedulerPlugin(),
  "@sentry/junior-sentry",
]);
```

```ts title="nitro.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "nitro";
import { juniorNitro } from "@sentry/junior/nitro";

export default defineConfig({
  preset: "vercel",
  modules: [
    juniorNitro({
      plugins: "./plugins",
    }),
  ],
  routes: {
    "/**": { handler: "./server.ts" },
  },
});
```

```ts title="server.ts"
import { createApp } from "@sentry/junior";

const app = await createApp();

export default app;
```

Use the second `defineJuniorPlugins` argument to adjust packaged manifest
defaults at install time:

```ts title="plugins.ts"
import { defineJuniorPlugins } from "@sentry/junior";

export const plugins = defineJuniorPlugins(["@sentry/junior-sentry"], {
  manifests: {
    sentry: {
      credentials: {
        domains: ["us.sentry.io", "de.sentry.io"],
      },
      oauth: {
        scope: "event:read org:read project:read",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

If you publish a manifest-only package with bundled skills, include
`plugin.yaml` and `skills` in package `files`. If the package needs runtime
hooks, export a JavaScript plugin factory instead of shipping `plugin.yaml`.

## Runtime hooks

Most plugins are manifest-only. Use a JavaScript plugin factory instead when a
package needs deterministic host behavior that cannot live in skill prose or
`plugin.yaml`. For example, the scheduler plugin registers schedule-management
tools and heartbeat behavior, and the GitHub plugin installs a sandbox Git
hook, configures global Git defaults, and injects commit attribution env before
bash commands run.

Runtime hooks are explicit app code because the app imports the plugin factory
into `plugins.ts`. A package should use either `plugin.yaml` or
`defineJuniorPlugin({ manifest, hooks })`, not both. Use
[Build a Plugin](/extend/build-a-plugin/) for the package authoring contract.

## Local skills vs plugin skills

Junior discovers both:

- App-local skills in `app/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Plugin-provided skills under each plugin’s `skills/` root

Use `app/skills` for skills that do not belong to a plugin. Use plugin skills when the skill depends on provider-specific capabilities or config.

## Build your own plugin

Most custom plugins should be declarative and use `plugin.yaml`. Add bundled
skills only when the package should also teach the agent provider-specific
workflows. Use a JavaScript plugin factory instead when the same package needs
runtime hooks.

### Minimal manifest

```yaml
name: my-provider
description: Internal workflow bundles
```

### Provider plugin with credentials

```yaml
name: my-provider
description: My provider integration

capabilities:
  - api.read
  - api.write

config-keys:
  - org
  - project

domains:
  - api.example.com
api-headers:
  X-Api-Version: "2026-01-01"

credentials:
  type: oauth-bearer
  domains:
    - api.example.com
  auth-token-env: EXAMPLE_AUTH_TOKEN
  auth-token-placeholder: host_managed_credential

oauth:
  client-id-env: EXAMPLE_CLIENT_ID
  client-secret-env: EXAMPLE_CLIENT_SECRET
  authorize-endpoint: https://example.com/oauth/authorize
  token-endpoint: https://example.com/oauth/token
  authorize-params:
    audience: workspace
  token-auth-method: basic
  token-extra-headers:
    Content-Type: application/json

runtime-dependencies:
  - type: npm
    package: example-cli
  - type: system
    package: gh
  - type: system
    url: https://example.com/tool.rpm
    sha256: 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef

runtime-postinstall:
  - cmd: example-cli
    args: ["install"]
```

### What the manifest fields mean

- `name`: unique lowercase plugin identifier; capabilities and config keys are qualified with it
- `description`: short summary of what the plugin integrates
- `capabilities`: provider actions qualified as `<plugin>.<capability>`
- `config-keys`: provider-specific configuration keys, qualified as `<plugin>.<key>`
- `domains` and `api-headers`: optional host-managed HTTP headers applied when matching sandbox requests are proxied through Junior; each provider domain can belong to only one plugin. Code-based plugins with egress credential hooks also declare their sandbox egress hosts in top-level `domains`.
- `command-env`: optional sandbox env vars for CLI placeholders, deployment defaults, public install metadata, and host env bindings explicitly marked safe for sandbox exposure
- `credentials`: generic token auth delivered by Junior's credential broker. The supported type is `oauth-bearer`, which requires `auth-token-env`. Plugin-owned egress credentials are not declared here; code-based plugins use top-level `domains` plus `grantForEgress` and `issueCredential` hooks.
- `oauth`: user OAuth setup; use it with `credentials.type: oauth-bearer`, or in a code-based plugin when an egress credential grant needs user authorization
- `target`: optional credential target scope tied to a declared config key
- `runtime-dependencies`: sandbox dependencies required by the plugin’s tools
- `runtime-postinstall`: commands that run after dependency install and before snapshot capture
- `mcp`: optional MCP server configuration for provider-scoped tool sources; `mcp.url` implies hosted HTTP transport, so `mcp.transport: http` is optional
- `env-vars`: optional map of deployment env vars the manifest may reference from `mcp.url`, `api-headers`, or `command-env`. Each key names an env var (uppercase, `[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*`) and may declare a `default` for `mcp.url` and `command-env`. Command-env references without defaults must set `expose-to-command-env: true` before they bind from host env; API header references cannot use defaults.
- `mcp.url`: supports `${VAR}` placeholders that must be declared in `env-vars`. This lets region-pinned providers pick the right host at deploy time without a manifest fork.
- `mcp.allowed-tools`: optional raw MCP tool-name allowlist when a plugin should expose only part of a provider's tool surface

### Env-var expansion in `mcp.url`

Some providers (Sentry self-hosted, GitHub Enterprise, Linear EU, ...) have different hostnames per region or deployment. The packaged plugin manifest keeps a single `mcp.url` and declares the deployment-level env vars it may read in an `env-vars` block. Defaults live in the declaration, not inline in the URL:

```yaml
env-vars:
  EXAMPLE_SITE:
    default: example.com

mcp:
  url: https://mcp.${EXAMPLE_SITE}/mcp
```

The only supported placeholder form is `${NAME}` — replaced with `process.env[NAME]`, falling back to the declared `default`. Plugin discovery fails loudly at load time if `NAME` is not listed in `env-vars`, or if it is listed without a default and the env var is unset.

`NAME` must match `[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*`. Every env var a manifest references must be declared in `env-vars`; placeholders that escape the declared allowlist are rejected at load time, so a manifest cannot opportunistically read ambient secrets (e.g. `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`) from the host process.

### API headers

Use top-level `api-headers` when a provider needs additional HTTP headers in sandbox requests. Junior applies these headers from the host when the sandbox egress proxy forwards a request to a matching `domains` entry. This can stand alone for header-authenticated providers or pair with `oauth-bearer` credentials. When paired with `oauth-bearer` credentials, the credential broker owns token headers such as `Authorization`; if both sources set the same header for the same domain, the credential header wins. Plugins with egress credential hooks should issue request-specific headers from `issueCredential`; `command-env` can carry non-secret sandbox CLI placeholders. Env-backed values use `${NAME}` placeholders declared in `env-vars`; unlike `mcp.url`, API header env vars cannot declare defaults because they may carry secrets.

```yaml
env-vars:
  EXAMPLE_AUTH_HEADER:

domains:
  - api.example.com

api-headers:
  Authorization: ${EXAMPLE_AUTH_HEADER}
  Content-Type: text/plain
```

Literal headers are also valid:

```yaml
domains:
  - api.example.com

api-headers:
  X-Api-Version: "2026-01-01"
```

### Command env

Use top-level `command-env` when a sandbox CLI needs env vars. This is commonly used for placeholder auth env vars so the CLI proceeds to make HTTP requests while Junior injects the real credentials from the host.

`command-env` values may be literals or `${NAME}` placeholders declared in `env-vars`. References with defaults expand at manifest load. References without defaults must set `expose-to-command-env: true`; they are read from host env when sandbox command env is resolved and skipped when unset.

Only expose values that are safe for sandbox code to read. `command-env` placeholders cannot reuse env vars that back `api-headers`, credential config, or OAuth config. For example, GitHub App bot names and noreply emails are safe to expose so git commits can be attributed correctly, but provider API keys and tokens belong in `api-headers` or credential brokers.

```yaml
env-vars:
  EXAMPLE_AUTH_HEADER:
  EXAMPLE_SITE:
    default: example.com
  EXAMPLE_BOT_EMAIL:
    expose-to-command-env: true

domains:
  - api.example.com
api-headers:
  Authorization: ${EXAMPLE_AUTH_HEADER}

command-env:
  EXAMPLE_API_KEY: host_managed_credential
  EXAMPLE_SITE: ${EXAMPLE_SITE}
  EXAMPLE_BOT_EMAIL: ${EXAMPLE_BOT_EMAIL}
```

### Optionally add skills to the plugin

Put bundled provider workflows under `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. Provider config keys belong in `plugin.yaml`, not in skill frontmatter.

```yaml
---
name: my-provider
description: Work with My Provider resources.
---
```

### Package it for discovery

Published manifest-only plugin packages must include `plugin.yaml` and any
bundled `skills` in `files`.

```json
{
  "name": "@acme/junior-example",
  "private": false,
  "type": "module",
  "files": ["plugin.yaml", "skills"]
}
```

Then install it in the host app:

```bash
pnpm add @acme/junior-example
```

Add the package name to `defineJuniorPlugins(...)`, then point
`juniorNitro({ plugins: "./plugins" })` at that module.

## Validate extensions

```bash
pnpm skills:check
```
