The scheduler plugin is built into `@sentry/junior`. It registers Slack tools for creating, listing, updating, deleting, and running scheduled tasks, then uses Junior's internal heartbeat to dispatch due work back to the configured Slack conversation.

## Runtime setup

No plugin package install is required. `createApp()` registers the trusted scheduler plugin automatically:

```ts title="server.ts"
import { createApp } from "@sentry/junior";

const app = await createApp();

export default app;
```

The Vercel helper includes the internal heartbeat route:

```ts title="vercel.config.ts"
import { juniorVercelConfig } from "@sentry/junior/vercel";

export default juniorVercelConfig();
```

If you manage routes manually, call the heartbeat route on a one-minute cadence:

| Route                     | Purpose                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `/api/internal/heartbeat` | Runs trusted plugin heartbeats. |

## Configure environment variables

Set one scheduler route secret:

| Variable                                   | Required   | Purpose                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CRON_SECRET` or `JUNIOR_SCHEDULER_SECRET` | Production | Bearer token for internal scheduler and heartbeat routes. Use `CRON_SECRET` with Vercel Cron. |
| `JUNIOR_TIMEZONE`                          | No         | Default IANA timezone for schedule authoring. Defaults to `America/Los_Angeles`.              |

Local development can run without a scheduler route secret when you call the dev server directly. Production deployments should set `CRON_SECRET` or `JUNIOR_SCHEDULER_SECRET`.

## Verify

Run the workflow in Slack where users will schedule work:

```text
remind me in 1 minute to stretch
```

Then confirm:

1. Junior acknowledges the scheduled task without asking for confirmation for the simple one-off reminder.
2. `what scheduled tasks do i have` lists the task in the same Slack conversation.
3. The reminder posts back to that conversation after the due time.

For recurring or non-reminder scheduled work, Junior should show the proposed task details and wait for confirmation before creating the task.

## Failure modes

- No due tasks run: confirm `/api/internal/heartbeat` is called every minute and the route secret matches the configured bearer token.
- Tasks list but never complete: check scheduler and dispatch logs for missing Slack destination fields or stale dispatch recovery errors.
- Unexpected timezone: set `JUNIOR_TIMEZONE` to the deployment default, or include the timezone in the user's schedule request.

## Next step
