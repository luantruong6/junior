## `@sentry/junior` (via `createApp()`)

The Hono app created by `createApp()` mounts a mix of root-level and `/api` routes.

Handled `GET` routes:

- `/`
- `/health`
- `/api/internal/heartbeat`
- `/api/oauth/callback/:provider`
- `/api/oauth/callback/mcp/:provider`

When `createApp({ dashboard })` mounts `@sentry/junior-dashboard`, the dashboard package owns `/`, `/api/dashboard/*`, and `/api/auth/*`; use `/health` for unauthenticated health checks. Plugin dashboard API routes are mounted under `/api/dashboard/plugins/:plugin/*` and inherit dashboard auth.

Handled `POST` routes:

- `/api/internal/agent-dispatch`
- `/api/internal/agent/continue`
- `/api/internal/plugin/tasks`
- `/api/webhooks/:platform` (Slack path is `/api/webhooks/slack`)

## Expected behavior

- Unknown routes return `404`.
- Queue callbacks validate queue topics and process conversation work or plugin
  background tasks.
- Webhook handler logs and surfaces non-success behavior for operators.

## Next step

Use [Verify & Troubleshoot](/start-here/verify-and-troubleshoot/) to validate these routes in your deployment, then inspect generated signatures in [API Reference Guide](/reference/api/).
