The scaffolded app is already shaped for Vercel. Deployment mainly means linking the project, keeping `juniorNitro()` in Nitro config, setting env vars, enabling snapshot warmup support, and pointing Slack at the production URL.

## Link the project

Authenticate and link the local app to a Vercel project:

```bash
pnpm dlx vercel@latest login
pnpm dlx vercel@latest link
```

If your account requires a team scope, pass the same `--scope <team-slug>` value to Vercel commands.

## Configure build command

The scaffolded `package.json` includes the production build script:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "check": "junior check",
    "dev": "vite dev",
    "build": "junior snapshot create && vite build"
  }
}
```

If your app uses Junior's SQL database, set the Vercel build command to run upgrades before the normal build:

```bash
pnpm exec junior upgrade && pnpm build
```

Otherwise, keep the Vercel build command as `pnpm build`. `junior snapshot create` prepares sandbox runtime dependencies declared by enabled plugins before request handling starts. When included in the build command, `junior upgrade` applies schema and state migrations before the new deployment serves traffic.

## Enable Junior's Nitro deployment module

Junior uses a one-minute internal heartbeat to run plugin heartbeats and recover stale agent dispatches. Durable agent work is also resumed by a Vercel Queue consumer. Both pieces are emitted by `juniorNitro()` into Nitro's Vercel Build Output config, which is the config Vercel deploys for Nitro apps.

Keep `juniorNitro()` installed in `nitro.config.ts`:

```ts title="nitro.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "nitro";
import { juniorNitro } from "@sentry/junior/nitro";

export default defineConfig({
  preset: "vercel",
  modules: [juniorNitro()],
  routes: {
    "/**": { handler: "./server.ts" },
  },
});
```

Do not configure `functions["api/internal/agent/continue.ts"]` in root `vercel.json`; Nitro does not deploy that source file as a Vercel function. `juniorNitro()` attaches the queue trigger to `/api/internal/agent/continue` with Nitro `vercel.functionRules`, and emits the `/api/internal/heartbeat` cron into `.vercel/output/config.json`.

The heartbeat endpoint returns `401` unless the incoming Vercel Cron request has a bearer token that matches `CRON_SECRET`.

## Configure production environment

Set the core runtime variables in Vercel:

| Variable                                    | Required    | Purpose                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`                      | Yes         | Verifies Slack requests.                                                       |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` or `SLACK_BOT_USER_TOKEN` | Yes         | Posts replies and calls Slack APIs.                                            |
| `REDIS_URL`                                 | Yes         | Queue and runtime state storage.                                               |
| `DATABASE_URL`                              | No          | Standard Neon/Vercel Postgres URL for Junior SQL records and reporting.        |
| `JUNIOR_DATABASE_URL`                       | No          | Override when Junior should use a different SQL database than `DATABASE_URL`.  |
| `JUNIOR_SECRET`                             | Yes         | Signs internal callbacks and sandbox requester context.                        |
| `CRON_SECRET`                               | Yes         | Authenticates Vercel Cron requests to the internal heartbeat route.            |
| `JUNIOR_BASE_URL`                           | Conditional | Canonical URL for OAuth and callback URLs when Vercel URL envs are not enough. |
| `JUNIOR_STATE_KEY_PREFIX`                   | No          | Redis key namespace for this deployment when sharing one Redis database.       |
| `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`                        | Optional    | AI Gateway auth when your setup requires it.                                   |

Use one stable `JUNIOR_SECRET` per deployment:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('node:crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))"
```

Plugin pages list provider-specific env vars such as GitHub App settings or Datadog keys.

Generate `CRON_SECRET` the same way and store it in Vercel for the production environment. Vercel Cron automatically sends it to cron targets as the `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` header.

## Enable snapshot warmup credentials

If enabled plugins need sandbox runtime dependencies, `junior snapshot create` runs during build. In Vercel, enable OIDC so `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` is available during the build.

Snapshot warmup also needs `REDIS_URL` during build because the snapshot registry is Redis-backed.

## Point Slack at production

Update these Slack URLs to your production domain:

```text
https://<your-domain>/api/webhooks/slack
```

Apply the URL to:

- Event Subscriptions
- Interactivity
- Slash command configured by `JUNIOR_SLASH_COMMAND` (defaults to `/jr`)

Reinstall the Slack app if scopes changed.

## Verify production

Run these checks after deployment:

1. `GET https://<your-domain>/health` returns `status: "ok"`.
2. `junior check` passes without deployment config errors.
3. The Vercel deployment has a cron entry for `/api/internal/heartbeat`.
4. The Vercel deployment has a Queue trigger for `/api/internal/agent/continue`.
5. A Slack mention produces a thread reply in the expected workspace.
6. App Home opens without an error.
7. Queue callback and agent-run logs show successful processing.
8. One enabled plugin workflow succeeds end to end.

## Next step

Use [Verify & Troubleshoot](/start-here/verify-and-troubleshoot/) for first-response checks, then monitor production with [Observability](/operate/observability/).
