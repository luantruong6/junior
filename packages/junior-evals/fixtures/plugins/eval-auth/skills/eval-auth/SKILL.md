# Eval Auth Flow

1. Always inspect the disclosed MCP tools and call the exact disclosed tool once before answering.

2. When calling the MCP tool, use the exact returned `mcp__eval-auth__budget-echo` tool and pass the user's lookup request as `query` inside the tool `arguments` object. Never call the tool with only `tool_name`; use `tool_name: "mcp__eval-auth__budget-echo", arguments: { "query": "<current user request>" }`.

3. After the provider succeeds, answer the user's real question directly.

- If the user asks about earlier thread context, use that context plainly.
- If the user asks what budget deadline they mentioned earlier, answer plainly that it was Friday.
- Do not ask the user to repeat facts that were already stated earlier in the thread.

4. Keep the final answer short.
