description: Clone repositories, inspect source, edit code, and manage pull requests with GitHub CLI. Use for repo implementation questions, cloning/editing, PR inspection/mutation, and PR auth-order questions. For PR auth order, answer that `git push` needs GitHub remote write access before `gh pr create`. Prefer this skill for repository and code tasks even when the repo concerns Sentry products.

# GitHub Code Operations

Repository checkout, source-code investigation, and pull request operations via `gh` CLI.

## Reference loading

| Operation     | Load                                                                                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Any operation | [references/api-surface.md](references/api-surface.md)                                 |
| On failure    | [references/troubleshooting-workarounds.md](references/troubleshooting-workarounds.md) |

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve operation and target

- Determine whether the task is `clone`, `source-code investigation`, a pull request inspection (`view`, `list`, `diff`, `checks`), or a pull request mutation (`create`, `update`, `close`, `merge`).
- Resolve repository (`owner/repo`). If not explicit, query channel config with `jr-rpc config get github.repo` before running any `gh` or `git` command. If still missing, ask the user.
- Run `jr-rpc config get github.repo` as its own bash command. Do not combine it with `cd`, `&&`, pipes, or any `gh` or `git` command.
- After resolving a configured repo, pass it explicitly to the next `gh` command with `--repo owner/repo`; do not rely on implicit GitHub CLI repository discovery.
- Resolve the pull request number for operations targeting an existing PR.
- Keep `--repo owner/repo` explicit on `gh` commands so the command itself targets the intended repository, not a stale default.

### 2. Execute by operation type

**Clone** → shallow clone path below.
**Source-code investigation** → source-code path below.
**Pull request inspection** → inspection path below.
**Pull request mutation** → mutation path below.

---

### Clone path

- Default to a shallow clone; deepen incrementally only when the task needs history.
- Use exact command forms from [references/api-surface.md](references/api-surface.md).
- After cloning, check for `AGENTS.md` in the repo root (and `.github/AGENTS.md`) before making edits. Treat discovered instructions as hard constraints.
- Report the local directory and whether the clone is shallow or full.

---

### Source-code investigation path

- Use for questions like "where is this implemented?", "how does this workflow work in code?", "is there already logic for X?", or "verify this from the repo."
- If the current workspace already contains the target repository, inspect local files directly before cloning.
- Do not treat this skill's `SKILL.md`, bundled references, or `/vercel/sandbox/skills/...` as target repository source code. If no checkout of the target repo is present, inspect the configured GitHub repository by cloning it shallowly or reading files through `gh` before answering.
- Prefer the narrowest deterministic evidence: local file search, exact file reads, targeted clone inspection, existing issues/PRs, tests.
- Cite repository evidence in the reply: file paths, symbols, issue/PR numbers, or commit references when known.
- If evidence is incomplete, say what is unknown instead of guessing.

---

### Pull request inspection path

- Use read-only `gh pr` commands from [references/api-surface.md](references/api-surface.md); skip branch resolution and push logic.
- Return canonical PR URL, PR number when available, target repository, and the fields the user asked to inspect.
- If the PR cannot be resolved, report the exact not-found or auth failure and stop.

---

### Pull request mutation path

#### 3. Resolve mutation inputs

- For PR creation credential/order questions, explicitly answer that repository context comes first, then `git push` pushes the branch with GitHub remote write access, then `gh pr create` runs against the pushed branch with pull-request permissions.
- For PR creation, resolve the base branch (explicit user request wins; otherwise repository default).
- Resolve the head branch from the current checkout or user request.
- If the head branch may not exist on the remote yet, push it explicitly before PR creation.

#### 4. Execute

- Run `git push` first so `gh pr create` does not trigger hidden push/fork behavior; then `gh pr create --repo owner/repo --head BRANCH ...`.
- If `git push` returns 401/403 or another auth/permission error, verify the command is targeting the right repository and retry once. If it still clearly indicates bad or revoked credentials, rerun the real GitHub command and let the runtime trigger a reconnect flow.
- Treat `gh pr merge` as a contents mutation and keep repository context explicit.

#### 5. Report result

- Return canonical PR URL, PR number when available, target repository, and applied changes.
- If PR creation fails after explicit push + explicit repo scoping, report the exact auth or validation failure and stop.

## Guardrails

- Require explicit confirmation only for destructive merges or force operations.
- Answer source-code questions from repository evidence, not product framing or generic memory.
- Default to shallow clones; do not use a full clone unless the task requires repository history or the user asks for it.
- If repository or installation access is missing, stop and return a concrete remediation message.
- Do not execute repository admin mutations.
