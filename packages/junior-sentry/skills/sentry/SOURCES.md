## Decisions

| Decision                                                                                             | Status   | Rationale                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use singular canonical command groups in runtime guidance.                                           | adopted  | Current docs and latest executable help use `issue`, `org`, `log`, and `trace`.                               |
| Add a live-help verification gate before blocking.                                                   | adopted  | Issue 271 showed a stale remembered command produced a false blocked answer.                                  |
| Keep `sentry api <endpoint>` as a read-only fallback.                                                | adopted  | Current CLI exposes an authenticated API escape hatch for resources not covered by high-level commands.       |
| Prefer `--json` and optional `--fields` for parsing.                                                 | adopted  | Current CLI supports machine-readable output across command groups.                                           |
| Treat Sentry product feature usage and explicit Sentry telemetry redirects as Sentry skill triggers. | adopted  | Issue 615 showed the previous trigger language under-specified product-introspection queries and let Hex win. |
| Preserve stale plural subcommands as recommended forms.                                              | rejected | `organizations list` was the root failure; aliases should not be taught as canonical command shapes.          |
| Create a broad new troubleshooting reference.                                                        | deferred | Current failure modes fit in the focused CLI reference without crowding `SKILL.md`.                           |

## Coverage matrix

| Dimension                          | Coverage status | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API surface and behavior contracts | complete        | `cli-commands.md` covers issue, org, log, trace, and API command shapes plus live help verification.                                                                                                     |
| Config/runtime options             | complete        | `sandbox-runtime.md`, `plugin.yaml`, and CLI configuration docs cover injected auth and runtime package installation.                                                                                    |
| Common use cases                   | complete        | `cli-commands.md` maps org listing, issue search/view/events, logs, traces, trace logs, and API fallback.                                                                                                |
| Product telemetry routing          | documented      | `SKILL.md` and `SPEC.md` cover Sentry product feature usage and explicit "Sentry telemetry" redirects after an unrelated auth pause. A dedicated eval should wait for the eval harness boundary cleanup. |
| Known issues/workarounds           | complete        | `cli-commands.md` troubleshooting covers stale plural commands, target syntax, JSON parsing, cache, auth, scope, and access failures.                                                                    |
| Version/migration variance         | complete        | The skill now treats live CLI help as final when references and installed CLI disagree.                                                                                                                  |

## Open gaps

- Review the Sentry CLI docs and rerun `pnpm dlx sentry@latest --help` when the plugin pins or upgrades beyond npm `sentry@0.30.0`.

## Changelog

- 2026-06-18: Expanded trigger language for Sentry product telemetry and feature usage, and recorded issue 615 routing evidence.
