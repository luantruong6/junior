description: Build, review, or update Junior extension skills and plugins. Use when users ask to create a Junior SKILL.md, app skill, plugin, plugin.yaml, packaged plugin, MCP-backed plugin, OAuth or credentialed plugin, or to validate Junior extension files. Do not use for ordinary Junior usage, provider workflows, generic code editing, or non-Junior agent-skill authoring.

## Workflow

1. Classify:

- App-local skill: behavior only, no provider-specific runtime authority.
- App-local plugin: provider or workflow bundle for one app.
- Packaged plugin: reusable plugin shipped as an npm package.
- Monorepo package: new or changed package under `packages/`.

2. Inspect:

- Inspect nearby `SKILL.md` files, `plugin.yaml` manifests, app docs, and package metadata.
- In this repo, treat `PLUGIN.md`, `specs/plugin.md`, `specs/credential-injection.md`, and validators as authoritative.
- Preserve: placement, manifest authority, credential secrecy, validation, discovery.

3. Choose shape:

- Skill only when no provider runtime setup is needed.
- Plugin when config, credentials, OAuth, MCP, packages, postinstall, or reuse is needed.
- References only for optional depth.

4. Author:

- Put skill behavior in `SKILL.md`.
- Put runtime authority in `plugin.yaml`.
- Put reusable package metadata in `package.json`.
- Keep secrets out of all committed files.

5. Validate:

- Run the narrowest structural check first.
- Fix every validation error before claiming the extension is complete.
- For runtime dependencies, verify snapshot creation or one real workflow when available.

## Hard rules

- Skill frontmatter owns activation only; plugin manifests own provider authority.
- Do not use `requires-capabilities` or `uses-config` in skills.
- Do not hardcode harness dispatcher mechanics in skill prose.
- Do not print, persist, or ask users to paste secrets into skill files.
- Do not create top-level `skills/` or `plugins/` in a Junior app unless local tooling explicitly requires that legacy layout.
- Do not invent manifest fields. If the parser does not support a field, omit it or change the runtime first.

## Reporting

1. Files created or changed.
2. Placement and discovery path.
3. Validation commands and result.
4. Remaining runtime verification: OAuth, MCP, credentials, snapshots, Slack.
