  "Ask a stronger advisor for deep technical guidance. Call this when the task has a hard reasoning core: algorithm design, architecture, concurrency, security-sensitive logic, data modeling, unclear requirements, repeated failures, difficult debugging, broad refactors, or final review of nontrivial work. Pass a focused question plus curated context containing the exact evidence, constraints, current plan, alternatives, command output, code snippets, or diffs the advisor should start from. The advisor does not automatically receive the parent transcript, keeps its own advisor history for this parent conversation, can use inspection tools to verify evidence, can reason deeply, and returns guidance for you to apply and verify. Follow-up calls can build on prior advisor guidance but must include any new evidence or changed constraints. Use it after initial orientation reads when repository context matters, before committing to a non-obvious implementation plan, when changing approach, when stuck, and before declaring complex work complete. Do not use it for greetings, simple deterministic edits, routine formatting, or tasks where the next action is already obvious from fresh tool output.";
