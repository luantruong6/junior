# Policies

Policies are short repo-wide defaults.

Use a policy doc when we want to say "this is how we normally do this here"
without turning it into a full architecture document or feature spec.

Good policy topics:

- code comments and docstrings
- frontend component styling
- testing expectations
- test adapters and harnesses
- naming conventions
- interface design
- runtime boundary schemas
- migration hygiene
- automation safety boundaries
- serverless background work

Keep policy docs small:

- explain the intent briefly
- state the default rule clearly
- call out only the meaningful exceptions

Use `policies/policy-template.md` for new policies.
