# Context-Bound Systems

## Intent

Runtime behavior should receive the authority, destination, and scope it needs as explicit context. Junior should not infer who is acting, where side effects belong, or which credentials apply from nearby metadata after work has crossed an async, durable, or platform boundary.

## Policy

- APIs that cross ingress, queue, callback, plugin, sandbox, scheduler, or durable-state boundaries must carry the identity context needed by the downstream behavior: current actor, destination, optional credential subject, and correlation ids.
- Shared context contracts that cross plugin, scheduler, dispatch, or durable-state boundaries must follow `./runtime-boundary-schemas.md`.
- Keep the current actor separate from author history, creator metadata, service-principal credentials, destination membership, requester-sensitive credential subjects, and display names.
- Validate untrusted platform or plugin payloads at the boundary that receives them. After Junior signs, persists, or dispatches context it owns, downstream code must assert that context exactly rather than normalize or repair it on read.
- Missing required context is an error, blocked state, or rejected input. Do not guess from prior messages, Slack channel membership, task creators, profile names, or synthetic sentinel values.
- Tool and model inputs must not supply privileged runtime context when the runtime can derive it from the active conversation, actor, destination, or artifact state.
- Display labels are presentation data. They may be sanitized for UX, but they must not become an identity source or overwrite actor ids.
- Retryable and resumable workflows must preserve the same identity context and idempotency context across retries and continuation slices.

## Exceptions

- Platform adapters may parse external payloads into exact internal identifiers at ingress.
- One-time migrations may explicitly repair old malformed state, but the migration must be named, bounded, and verified separately from normal runtime reads.
