## Status

Active

## Purpose

Define the normative architecture contract for `packages/junior/src/chat` so new work converges on explicit composition, small service interfaces, and maintainable test seams.

## Scope

- File-tree structure and responsibility boundaries for `packages/junior/src/chat`.
- Runtime/service/state composition rules.
- Test and eval seams for chat runtime behavior.

## Non-Goals

- Re-specifying user-facing Slack product behavior already covered by runtime, OAuth, queue, and testing specs.
- Forcing immediate directory moves for every legacy module before the cutover is complete.

## Engineering Principles

- Optimize for obvious code over flexible-but-indirect abstractions.
- Keep public interfaces small and intention-revealing; add a new seam only when there is clear reuse or a real boundary.
- Let file and module structure carry context so names do not have to repeat it.
- Keep exported names specific to their role; keep local helper names short when the surrounding file already provides context.
- Prefer domain language over mechanism language; if a name sounds like transport or wiring rather than product behavior, it is probably the wrong level.
- If a function or type name keeps growing qualifiers to stay understandable, split the module boundary instead of extending the name again.

## Contracts

### File Tree Responsibilities

- `app/`: composition roots only. Build concrete implementations and assemble runtime instances.
- `ingress/`: inbound event normalization, classification, and queue handoff only.
- `runtime/`: turn orchestration only.
- `services/`: domain services with injected collaborators.
- `state/`: adapter selection plus store modules split by concern.
- `slack/`: Slack-specific client, output formatting, and channel/user helpers.
- `ai/`: provider-facing AI clients.
- `queue/`: queue transport and queue worker orchestration.
- `turn/`: turn lifecycle state and resumability.
- `tools/`, `plugins/`, `capabilities/`, `sandbox/`: domain-specific integrations that consume the above boundaries.

### Import Direction Rules

- `app/` may import any chat module needed to assemble the runtime.
- Non-`app/` modules must not import from `app/`.
- `runtime/` may depend on `services/`, `state/`, `queue/`, `turn/`, `slack/`, and pure helpers.
- `services/` must not depend on `runtime/`.
- `services/` must not import Slack infrastructure; use small injected ports owned by the service when a domain service needs Slack-backed data or files.
- `slack/` modules must not import runtime orchestration modules.
- `state/` must not depend on `runtime/` or service modules.
- `ingress/` may route into queue/runtime entrypoints, but must not own business logic that belongs in `runtime/` or `services/`.

**Verification:** `pnpm run test:arch-boundary` enforces these rules via static import analysis.

### Service Interface Rules

- Do not use mutable runtime service globals or singleton mutation APIs for behavior seams.
- Do not introduce broad deps bags or service locators for runtime behavior.
- Prefer small consumer-owned interfaces that describe one responsibility.
- Default production implementations may live beside a service, but composition roots must be able to construct explicit service instances.
- Do not leak third-party SDK types across subsystem boundaries when a small local interface will do. Infrastructure modules may use vendor SDKs internally, but higher layers should depend on local contracts.

### Core Interface Targets

The following boundaries are the canonical interfaces for the chat runtime. New work must converge on these shapes even if legacy files still exist during cutover.

#### Runtime Composition Root

- One composition root creates the concrete Slack chat app runtime for production.
- Production singleton assembly belongs under `app/` rather than worker or runtime modules.
- One thin test fixture may create local runtime instances for tests and evals.
- Queue workers, ingress routers, and handlers must depend on a runtime instance or runtime factory, not import the production singleton.

Target role:

```ts
interface ChatRuntimeFactory {
  create(options?: RuntimeOverrides): ChatTurnRuntime;
}
```

#### Turn Runtime

- The turn runtime owns message-handling orchestration for mentions, subscribed-thread messages, and assistant lifecycle events.
- It may depend on services, state stores, and observability, but must not depend on ingress transport or queue clients.

Target role:

```ts
interface ChatTurnRuntime {
  handleMention(thread, message, hooks?): Promise<void>;
  handleSubscribedMessage(thread, message, hooks?): Promise<void>;
  handleAssistantThreadStarted(event): Promise<void>;
  handleAssistantContextChanged(event): Promise<void>;
}
```

#### Ingress Router

- Ingress owns event normalization, dedupe, thread-kind classification, and queue handoff.
- Chat SDK compatibility should be expressed through an explicit `Chat` subclass or wrapper, not prototype mutation or import-side effects.
- Ingress must not become a second authority for turn behavior that already belongs in runtime.
- Canonical ingress code lives under `chat/ingress/*`. Do not reintroduce legacy patch modules for core ingress behavior.

Target role:

```ts
interface MessageIngressRouter {
  route(event, deps): Promise<IngressRouteResult>;
}
```

#### Queue Dispatcher

- The queue worker owns serialization, locking, ordering, and retry interaction.
- Queue dispatch into the turn runtime must be an injected boundary.
- Queue worker code must not import the production bot singleton.
- Provider transport should stay behind a local queue transport module so retry policy and handler semantics remain project-owned.

Target role:

```ts
interface QueuedMessageDispatcher {
  dispatch(payload, runtime): Promise<void>;
}
```

#### Capability And Plugin Catalog

- Capability and plugin discovery are runtime services, not ambient global registries.
- Test or eval-only plugin roots must be provided through local fixtures or composition-bound catalogs, not module-level global mutation.
- Environment-driven mode switches must be isolated to composition roots.
- Token stores should be created from the current state adapter at the call site or injected factory boundary, not hidden behind ambient module singletons.

Target role:

```ts
interface PluginCatalog {
  listProviders(): PluginProvider[];
  listMcpProviders(): PluginProvider[];
  getOAuthConfig(provider): OAuthConfig | undefined;
}

interface ProviderCredentialIssuer {
  issueLease(args): Promise<CredentialLease>;
}
```

#### Eval Scenario Harness

- The eval harness may replace transport, auth completion, and reply generation with local fixtures.
- The eval harness must not become a second runtime architecture.
- Harness overrides should be scenario-oriented and map to real runtime seams rather than adding arbitrary knobs.

Target role:

```ts
interface EvalScenarioRunner {
  run(caseDef): Promise<UserVisibleArtifacts>;
}
```

### State Rules

- State access must be split by concern rather than kept in one kitchen-sink module.
- Adapter/backend selection belongs in the adapter layer.
- Key-building, TTL policy, and persistence rules belong in store modules.
- Consumers should import the narrowest store they need rather than routing all access through a broad facade.

### Test And Eval Rules

- Tests and evals must instantiate local runtimes through composition roots or thin fixtures over them.
- Prefer `vi.spyOn(...)` or narrow service overrides at real module boundaries over new production test hooks.
- Do not mutate the production singleton runtime to drive behavior tests.
- Message evals must exercise the real ingress and queue worker path, with only the external transport replaced by an in-memory shim.

### Terminology Rules

- Use domain-role names, not mechanism names.
- Prefer names that are easy to read in local context over names that encode the whole call path.
- Avoid `patch` in canonical module names for core runtime behavior.
- Avoid `behavior` for generic harness override bags; prefer `scenario`, `fixture`, or `overrides`.
- Use `runtime` only for actual turn/lifecycle orchestration layers, not for thin wrappers or helpers.
- Use `dispatcher` for queue-to-runtime handoff and `router` for ingress decision/routing.
- Avoid `app` as a prefix for modules inside `src/chat` unless the module is specifically a composition root.

Current names that should be treated as transitional:

- None in the core runtime path. New runtime naming should follow the `slackRuntime` / `createSlackRuntime` / `SubscribedReplyDecision` / `AssistantLifecycleEvent` vocabulary now in the tree.

### Remaining Cutover Requirements

The following conditions are still architectural debt and should be treated as non-end-state:

1. Plugin and capability discovery still flow through a default module-level catalog cache instead of fully injected catalogs.
2. Eval harness still owns too many environment and runtime control knobs.
3. Legacy compatibility exports like `botConfig` still exist; new code should prefer explicit config readers when it needs more than one value or subsystem.

### Migration Sequence

1. Document the contract in `AGENTS.md` and canonical specs.
2. Replace runtime-global behavior seams with injected services.
3. Split state into adapter + concern-specific stores.
4. Remove singleton-only queue dispatch and move runtime assembly fully behind explicit factories.
5. Replace prototype-patch ingress with an explicit ingress router boundary.
6. Replace plugin/capability registries with composition-bound catalogs and factories.
7. Shrink harness and remaining test hooks to local runtime fixtures or boundary spies.

Legacy modules may remain during cutover, but new code must follow this contract and refactors should delete old seams rather than preserve them.

## Failure Model

- Adding new mutable runtime test hooks, service locators, or broad deps bags is a contract violation.
- Hiding business logic in ingress wrappers, state adapters, or singleton bootstrap modules is a contract violation.
- Queue or worker code importing the production singleton runtime is a contract violation.
- Prototype mutation or import-side-effect wiring as the canonical ingress model is a contract violation.
- Duplicating reply-decision authority across ingress and runtime is a contract violation.
- If a change needs a new seam, prefer a local factory/service interface; if it cannot be expressed that way, stop and update this spec first.

## Observability

- Observability ownership stays with the domain module doing the work; composition roots wire dependencies but should not add behavior-specific logging.
- Logging and tracing conventions remain governed by `specs/logging/index.md`.

## Verification

- `rg "getBotDeps|setBotDepsForTests|resetBotDepsForTests|runtime/deps"` should stay empty for production chat runtime code.
- Typecheck and focused tests must pass for any touched runtime/service/state path.
- Behavior changes to chat architecture must update this spec, `AGENTS.md`, and the relevant testing docs in the same change.
