# Spec Index

## Metadata

## Purpose

Define spec taxonomy, naming conventions, and canonical source-of-truth documents for Junior.

## Template

- New specs must start from `specs/spec-template.md`.
- Required metadata fields are enforced by `specs/AGENTS.md`.

## Taxonomy

- Canonical normative specs: active implementation contracts that must match current runtime behavior.
- Policy specs: security and governance constraints (`*-policy.md`).
- Archive specs: historical evaluations, completed trackers, and superseded design docs (`specs/archive/**`).

## Naming Rules

- Normative specs use concise kebab-case names. The `-spec` suffix is allowed but not required.
- Policy specs use `*-policy.md`.
- Historical docs are moved to `specs/archive/` and must not be treated as canonical implementation contracts.

## Available Docs

- `specs/security-policy.md`
- `specs/data-redaction-policy.md`

## Ownership Map

For chat/agent/Slack execution and response behavior:

- `specs/terminology.md` owns canonical execution vocabulary and historical `turn` naming rules.
- `specs/chat-architecture.md` owns the end-to-end platform-event-to-agent-run data flow, platform adapter boundary, data authority map, and module boundaries.
- `specs/task-execution.md` owns durable conversation mailbox execution, queue wake-up semantics, conversation leases, cooperative yield, and heartbeat repair.
- `specs/local-agent.md` owns local CLI/local adapter user flows, identity, state, delivery, and verification contracts.
- `specs/agent-turn-handling.md` owns user-message response policy: when Junior answers, stays silent, asks, uses tools, satisfies Slack side effects, handles resumed turns, and considers a turn complete.
- `specs/agent-execution.md` owns coding-agent execution discipline and the repository-wide model-repairable tool failure contract.
- `specs/harness-agent.md` owns the Pi agent run runtime contract, final output resolution, and diagnostics.
- `specs/harness-tool-context.md` owns context-bound tool targeting and missing-context failure behavior.
- `specs/agent-session-resumability.md` owns session record schema, Pi session continuation, timeout callbacks, and slice lifecycle.
- `specs/context-compaction.md` owns reusable Pi history compaction, internal context forks, and visible-thread compaction bounds.
- `specs/slack-agent-delivery.md` owns Slack entry surfaces, progress UX, continuation acknowledgements, and final reply delivery.
- `specs/slack-outbound-contract.md` owns Slack API write formatting, file uploads, reactions, retries, and error mapping.
- `specs/identity.md` owns current actor, system actor, requester, author, creator, credential subject, service principal, and display identity separation across runtime boundaries.

## Archived Superseded Specs

- `specs/archive/provider-catalog.md` (superseded by `specs/plugin.md`)

## Archive Policy

- Archive documents preserve historical context and decisions but are non-normative.
- If an archive and canonical spec conflict, canonical spec wins.
- New implementation changes must update canonical specs, not archive docs.
