## Intent

Integration tests validate real runtime wiring and Slack-facing behavior, with deterministic control only at the agent boundary. Use this layer when the contract depends on production composition, handler routing, external transport behavior, or user-visible runtime outcomes. Evals take this role only when the contract is agent-facing behavior that depends on model interpretation.

## Scope

In scope:

- Slack event ingestion and routing behavior.
- Runtime orchestration and state interactions.
- Slack HTTP contracts (request shape, retries, error mapping) through MSW.
- Auth callback and resume flows, persisted thread recovery, and other user-visible product wiring.
- Behavior outcomes from real runtime flow using deterministic fake-agent outputs.

## Non-Goals

- Pure algorithmic invariants better covered by unit tests.
- Deterministic service/runtime contracts better covered by component tests.
- Judge-scored conversational quality (belongs to evals).

## Required Runtime Shape

1. Use real app/runtime modules for behavior paths.
2. Use MSW handlers and Slack fixtures for outbound Slack HTTP.
3. Keep persistence/routing code real unless the test is explicitly categorized as unit.

## Substitution Policy

Allowed:

- Fake agent or service substitution at the composition boundary only (`createSlackRuntime(...)`, `createTestChatRuntime(...)`, or approved thin wrapper helpers over them).

Disallowed in integration behavior tests:

- Mutable runtime-global behavior seams or singleton patching for core chat behavior.
- `vi.mock` for runtime behavior modules (`@/chat/state/*`, workflow router/runtime handlers, ingress binding/router paths, etc.).
- Ad-hoc stubbing of Slack HTTP fetch/webclient internals in test files.
- Ad-hoc fake persistence or fake Slack delivery layers when the shared memory adapter + MSW harness can prove the same contract.

## Fixture and Harness Rules

1. Use `packages/junior/tests/fixtures/slack/*` factories and harness helpers.
2. Use `packages/junior/tests/msw/*` handler utilities for Slack API sequencing and assertions.
3. Prefer scenario-style tests that drive events and assert resulting user-visible outputs + captured Slack API calls.

## Behavior vs Transport-Contract Tests

Both of the following remain integration tests when they use the real runtime path:

1. Behavior integration tests:
   - describe the scenario in user/runtime terms
   - assert user-visible outcomes first
   - avoid framing the test around internal call choreography
2. Slack transport-contract integration tests:
   - assert request payload shape, stream lifecycle, recipient metadata, or other Slack API details when those details are the real external contract
   - should live in dedicated `*contract*.test.ts` files or clearly separated contract-focused suites

Do not let low-level stream ordering or request-shape assertions dominate general `*-behavior.test.ts` files.

## Classification Guidance

If a test relies on runtime module mocks to drive control-flow branches, classify it as unit or component instead of integration.

If the behavior under test depends on natural-language interpretation, continuity, or model choice, classify it as eval instead of integration.

If a product/runtime change can be proven only by real wiring plus a deterministic fake agent, integration is the right answer. If the contract is a deterministic store, worker, queue-port, lease, or service-coordination invariant, prefer a component test.

Do not keep a scenario in integration solely because a fake classifier fixture is easier than writing the corresponding eval. When the real contract is ambiguous natural-language behavior or reply quality, promote it to eval.

## Core Scenarios to Cover

1. Mention and subscribed-thread routing behavior.
2. Rapid same-thread message ordering/continuity.
3. Error handling that remains user-visible and non-silent.
4. Slack API contract correctness for tools/actions used by runtime paths.
5. Context-bound tool targeting behavior (harness-resolved targets, no model-selected destination overrides).

## Workflow Coverage Requirements

Integration tests that cover workflow ingress/execution must assert workflow-boundary behavior, not just handler internals:

1. Verify ingress payloads sent to workflow routing are serializable and contain serialized `chat:Message` / `chat:Thread` data (no function-valued fields).
2. Exercise the real message-kind routing behavior (`new_mention` vs `subscribed_message`) through `routeIncomingMessageToWorkflow(...)`.
3. Validate de-dup behavior on ingress and de-dup behavior in workflow stream processing.

## Context-Bound Tool Coverage Requirements

For tools governed by harness context (for example Slack channel/canvas/list operations):

1. Assert destination/target comes from harness/runtime context rather than model-supplied IDs.
2. Assert missing context fails safely with actionable error responses.
3. Assert disallowed fallback scopes (for example bot-private artifacts for shared deliverables) are not used.

## Scope Discipline (Do Not Over-Test)

Integration tests should prove wiring and external behavior contracts, not exhaust every edge-case permutation.

Required approach:

1. Cover one representative happy path per runtime contract.
2. Add failure-path coverage only for distinct, realistic regressions.
3. Add edge-case coverage when:
   - the behavior has caused production bugs before, or
   - the edge case changes routing/safety semantics.

Avoid:

1. Duplicating the same assertion across multiple near-identical payload variants.
2. Asserting internal call choreography that is not part of the contract. If request ordering is the contract, move it into a dedicated transport-contract integration test instead of a general behavior file.
3. Encoding speculative edge cases with no concrete bug history or risk signal.

## Enforcement

`pnpm lint` enforces integration boundary policy for designated behavior integration tests.
