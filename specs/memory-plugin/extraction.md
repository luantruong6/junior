## Purpose

Define passive memory learning through completed agent-run processing
and the memory-owned internal extraction agent.

## What Belongs In Memory

A stored memory is a self-contained assertion that can improve future
assistance without requiring the original conversation.

A candidate may be stored only when all of these are true:

1. Install-level memory policy allows this category, scope, and source.
2. It is a public/shareable concrete fact, preference, relationship, durable
   project fact, durable workflow preference, or explicit user request to
   remember something.
3. It is useful beyond the current request/session or has an explicit
   expiration.
4. It is understandable without unresolved pronouns or hidden conversation
   context.
5. It has a runtime-derived source actor and source conversation.
6. It has a runtime-derived visibility scope.
7. It contains no credential, token, private key, password, recovery code,
   connection string with credentials, payment card number, or similar secret.
8. It is not merely an assistant claim, assistant action, assistant summary of
   a tool result, system capability, implementation detail, or prompt/routing
   rule.
9. Personal-scoped identity, preference, or relationship facts are first-person
   facts authored by the current requester, not third-person profile facts
   about someone else.
10. It has a valid subject type: `user` for the current requester,
    `conversation` for the current conversation, or `general` for public
    operational/domain knowledge.

Examples that can be stored:

- `Prefers concise technical answers.`
- `Production deploy window is Mondays from 10:00 to 12:00 UTC.`
- `Incident follow-up lives in Linear.`
- `Revenue cohort analysis should use the finance-modeled warehouse tables.`
- `The Acme migration is paused.`

Examples that must not be stored:

- `The assistant searched GitHub.`
- `The user asked a question about the memory system.`
- `The OAuth token is xoxb-...`
- `David is on the billing team.` when proposed as David's personal memory by
  someone other than David
- `The requester prefers concise technical answers.`
- `My favorite CLI QA snack is mango chips.`
- `This thread says incident follow-up lives in Linear.`
- `The user is somewhere next week.`
- `The user has not decided what to do.`
- `Junior can use the scheduler plugin.`
- `Today's signup conversion rate is 8.4%.`
- `There are 17 open incidents right now.`

## Passive Learning

The memory plugin processes completed agent runs through a typed
`session.completed` plugin task. Conceptually this is a memory compaction pass:
the task loads a bounded completed-run projection and asks the memory-owned
extraction agent which durable public/shareable facts, if any, should survive
as long-term memory.

The `processSession` task must:

1. Run only after the user-visible agent run is delivered and the completed
   session record is durably committed enough that task failure cannot fail
   delivery.
2. Receive task params that contain stable references only, such as
   `conversationId` and `sessionId`. Params must not duplicate raw messages,
   source, destination, requester, tool payloads, or model output.
3. Load a bounded core-owned run projection from transcript/session storage.
   The projection may include normalized user-authored messages, assistant
   reply text, and bounded tool-result text, but not raw Pi internals, raw tool
   arguments, full transcript history, private tool payloads, provider
   credentials, or unrelated conversation context.
4. Skip passive extraction for unsupported sources. V1 supports local CLI
   sessions and `pub` sources with a stable source key. Non-local `priv`
   sources and sources without stable identity are ignored before model
   extraction.
5. Skip passive extraction when the completed session called a memory tool
   (`createMemory`, `removeMemory`, `listMemories`, or `searchMemories`).
   Memory tool turns already operate on memory-aware context; passive
   extraction must not reinterpret recalled or listed memories as fresh source
   evidence.
6. Recalled or listed memories are context for the visible answer and dedupe,
   not source evidence for creating new memories.
7. Provide visible existing memories as dedupe context only, not as source
   evidence for new memories.
8. Use assistant-authored text only as context for interpreting the completed
   run; assistant claims are not independent source evidence.
9. Extract candidate facts with a structured model output contract.
10. Reject malformed, incoherent, unsafe, out-of-scope, redundant, or
    non-durable facts.
11. Assign requester or conversation target from the memory kind returned by
    the memory agent, while deriving all authority-bearing ids from runtime
    context.
12. Insert accepted memories idempotently with a stable key derived through the
    runtime source helper, completed session reference, and extracted fact
    content.
13. Generate embeddings for accepted rows when the host embedder is configured.
14. Avoid storing raw extraction prompt, raw model output, or raw run text
    beyond the accepted memory records.

Plugin tasks are best effort and at least once. If extraction or storage fails,
Junior logs safe metadata, retries according to core task policy, and the
completed user-visible run remains successful. Duplicate task delivery must not
create duplicate memories.

## Extraction Rules

Passive run extraction must follow these rules:

1. Extract only from user-authored text and bounded tool-result text.
2. Prefer explicit `createMemory` tool writes over inferred passive learning.
3. Store facts, not conversation summaries.
4. Make content self-contained and perspective-neutral.
5. Reject unresolved references such as "that", "it", "the thing", "someone",
   or "somewhere" when the referenced value is not present.
6. Reject negative knowledge such as "the user has not decided yet".
7. Reject assistant/system implementation details.
8. Reject low-utility facts that will not help 30 days later unless they have
   explicit expiration.
9. Reject workplace-sensitive categories, such as
   HR/performance, protected-class, health, legal, financial, gossip, or
   coworker speculation.
10. Reject private or sensitive content instead of storing it under personal
    scope.
11. In V1 passive extraction, prioritize conversation-scoped task, process,
    runbook, project, channel, and operational knowledge.
12. Prefer reusable "how to achieve the result" knowledge when it took effort
    to discover: stable source-of-truth, query location, workflow,
    prerequisite, caveat, or decision path.
13. Direct answers to user inquiries may be stored only when they are durable
    operational/project knowledge. Do not store point-in-time analytics,
    search, issue, metric, incident, availability, or status answers whose
    values naturally change.
14. A user question is not source evidence for the answer; passive extraction
    may store the answer only when user-authored factual text or a non-memory
    tool result supports it.
15. Personal-scoped memories must be public/shareable first-person facts from
    the current author/requester, and should be stored passively only when they
    are clearly durable and useful beyond the active task.
16. Assign `user` subject only for the current author/requester; do not create
    third-party user subjects in V1.
17. Preserve provenance for third-party claims when the source matters for
    correctness.
18. Store the minimum useful assertion rather than a direct quote or broad
    summary.
19. Store ownership, subject, and provenance in structured fields, not content
    prose. Remove requester names, display names, `the requester`, `the user`,
    `I`, `my`, thread labels, channel labels, and source labels from accepted
    content.

The plugin must route extracted candidates through the memory agent before
storage. The extraction prompt is guidance, not the security boundary.

## Memory Agent Review

The memory agent is the shared internal semantic system for explicit
`createMemory` candidates and passive extraction candidates. Passive extraction
may use separate generate-and-review model calls internally, but both steps
belong to the memory agent rather than a caller-provided policy hook.

The default V1 passive-extraction shape is:

1. The memory agent proposes structured candidate memories from the bounded
   completed-run projection.
2. The memory agent accepts only candidates that satisfy public/shareable memory
   guidance.
3. Deterministic validation applies only hard structural rules, such as schema
   shape, runtime-owned authority, source visibility, lifecycle bounds,
   idempotency, and storage constraints before storage.

Memory agent review should receive only the candidate memory or bounded
completed-run transcript, the minimum source context needed to judge it, and
public/shareable memory guidance. It should not receive unrestricted transcript
history, raw tool arguments, private tool payloads, provider credentials, or
unrelated conversation context unless those fields are part of the bounded
extraction input. Prompt inputs should use the same structured context-block
style as Junior's run context, with separate `<runtime>` and source blocks.
Explicit `createMemory` review uses a singular `<candidate>` block and the
current user-authored message as bounded source context. Passive extraction
uses the completed run's bounded transcript plus visible existing memories for
dedupe. Existing memories must not be used as source evidence for new facts.

The memory agent model is host-owned but selected by the memory plugin. An
explicit `createMemoryPlugin({ modelId })` option wins, then `AI_MEMORY_MODEL`,
then the host default model. Model choice is an implementation tuning knob;
runtime context, source authority, and storage validation remain the boundary.

Memory agent output must be structured. For explicit review it should include:

- decision: `store` or `reject`
- memory kind when stored: `preference`, `procedure`, or `fact`
- canonical stored content when stored
- optional expiration when stored
- normalized rejection reason code when rejected

For passive extraction it should include one `memories` array of accepted
candidate memories. Each candidate includes:

- `kind`: `preference`, `procedure`, or `fact`
- canonical stored content
- optional expiration

The memory agent should return one object per distinct source assertion rather
than separate categorized arrays. The runtime derives storage target from
`kind`: requester memory for `preference`, conversation memory for `procedure`
and `fact`.

Conversation-target passive memories in V1 are the primary path for learning
how work gets done: task procedures, runbooks, project facts, channel norms,
and operational knowledge. Requester-target passive memories are secondary and
limited to clearly durable first-person preferences, opinions, and habits.
Broader public requester facts can still be handled by the explicit reviewed
`createMemory` path. Rejections are represented by omitting a candidate from the
array.

The content field is canonical stored memory text. Requester memory content
must omit ownership from prose because ownership lives in structured metadata.
For example, `I prefer terse PR summaries` should become requester memory
`Prefers terse PR summaries`, and `This thread says deploy runbooks require
staging checks first` should become conversation memory `Deploy runbooks require
staging checks first`.

The memory agent may narrow, rewrite, or reject extracted candidates, but it
may not override hard structural validators. If extraction and review disagree,
the stricter outcome wins. If the memory agent fails or returns malformed
output, the candidate is rejected unless it came from an explicit tool
workflow that can return a model-visible retryable error.

## Secret Rejection

Every entry point must use the same policy guidance before writing memory
content:

- `createMemory`
- passive extraction
- repair/import workflows
- tests and fixture helpers that create real memory records

Explicit tools may use explicit user intent as a policy input, but they do not
bypass the policy guidance. Secret handling may use a dedicated scanner as a
hard safety backstop, but scanner matches are not a substitute for agentic
memory eligibility decisions.

The policy guidance must reject at least:

- API keys and access tokens
- Slack tokens
- passwords and passphrases
- private keys
- recovery codes and MFA codes
- credit card numbers
- Social Security numbers
- connection strings with embedded credentials

If a user explicitly asks Junior to remember a secret, the correct behavior is
a model-visible rejection, not storage with a special classification.

## Duplicate And Supersession Rules

Duplicate prevention is required before insertion where the relevant signal is
available:

- same source, completed session reference, target, normalized content, and
  expiration marker
- high lexical or embedding similarity to an active memory in the same scope

V1 storage enforces source/fact idempotency. Exact normalized-content equality
is not a durable identity for memory facts and must not be the only duplicate
suppression strategy.

Supersession is allowed when a new memory clearly replaces an old memory in the
same scope, such as a changed preference. Superseded memories remain archived
in place and are excluded from recall and list results unless explicitly
requested by an administrative repair workflow.

V1 may implement conservative supersession only. If conflict is uncertain,
store the new fact without archiving the old one or skip the new fact; do not
guess.
