## Purpose

Define Junior's first long-term memory implementation as an explicitly enabled
runtime hook plugin with strict storage, recall, visibility, and deletion
contracts.

## Implementation Status

This spec describes the intended V1 memory plugin shape. Generic plugin prompt
hooks and plugin prompt session state are available through
`../plugin-prompt-hooks.md`. Passive learning uses the typed task contract in
`../plugin-tasks.md`: a `session.completed` task loads a bounded completed-run
projection and invokes the memory-owned internal extraction agent.

V1 stores only public/shareable memory content. Scope controls who can see a
record; it is not a content sensitivity model. Private, sensitive, secret, or
otherwise restricted content is rejected instead of being stored with a
classification label.

When the memory plugin is enabled, it makes relevant facts available before each
response without making recall depend on the model choosing a search tool.
Explicit tools also support user-directed memory management.

## Scope

- What is eligible for long-term memory.
- Default V1 policy guidance for workplace-safe extraction and recall.
- Memory plugin package shape and required plugin hooks.
- Plugin-owned SQL storage, retrieval indexes, embeddings, and model-provider
  boundaries.
- Automatic recall through `userPrompt` when the memory plugin is enabled.
- Passive learning through the memory plugin's `session.completed` task.
- Explicit `createMemory`, `removeMemory`, `listMemories`, and
  `searchMemories` tools.
- Scope, attribution, lifecycle, tool, model, public-content, and secret
  rejection rules.
- V1 capability boundaries and verification requirements.

## Non-Goals

- A core memory API outside the plugin system.
- A canonical person graph, alias resolver, or multi-hop social retrieval.
- Storing private, sensitive, secret, or otherwise restricted memory content in
  V1.
- Cross-context recall between unrelated conversations.
- Requiring search tools for default recall.
- Storing conversation transcript history as memory.
- Storing credentials, secrets, raw OAuth data, or provider tokens.
- Letting model-supplied tool arguments choose actors, Slack workspaces,
  channels, teams, or arbitrary visibility scopes.
- Exposing memory content through logs, traces, dashboard metadata, or plugin
  operational reports for private conversations.

## Spec Map

Read these files as one canonical spec:

- [storage.md](./storage.md): SQL storage model, retrieval indexes, pgvector,
  embedding model provider, and operational storage rules.
- [policy.md](./policy.md): default V1 controls for memory categories, passive
  extraction, workplace-sensitive facts, model/provider use, and retention.
- [security.md](./security.md): authority boundaries, multi-user visibility,
  model/tool boundaries, task payload safety, and redaction rules.
- [retrieval.md](./retrieval.md): automatic recall, tool-mediated recall,
  hybrid ranking, automatic injection mechanics, and performance strategy.
- [extraction.md](./extraction.md): passive session processing, extraction,
  storable-fact policy, semantic duplicate detection, and supersession.
- [tools.md](./tools.md): model-visible memory management and recall tools.
- [admin.md](./admin.md): future operator/admin CLI command shape for memory
  inspection and repair.
- [verification.md](./verification.md): failure model, observability, and test
  requirements.

## User Stories

V1 memory must satisfy these product stories:

1. As a requester, I can ask Junior to remember a public/shareable first-person
   fact about me and have Junior recall it for me later.
2. As a requester, I cannot create a personal memory about another person,
   because personal user-subject memories are owned by the current
   author/requester.
3. As a public conversation participant, I can ask Junior to remember shared
   operational knowledge for that conversation.
4. As a requester, I can list, search, and remove memories visible in the
   current context without giving the model actor ids, Slack ids, or arbitrary
   scope selectors.
5. As an installer, I can enable memory knowing private, sensitive, and secret
   content is rejected rather than stored with a dormant classification.
6. As an operator, I can add embeddings, lexical indexes, or future graph
   indexes as derived data without changing the authoritative memory ownership
   model.

## Design Inputs

The V1 shape is informed by `~/src/ash/specs/memory/*` and a prior-art pass over
qmd, Mem0/OpenMemory, Supermemory, Zep/Graphiti, Cognee, Letta, and MemU. The
common durable-storage pattern is an authoritative scoped memory row plus
derived retrieval indexes, source attribution, lifecycle state, and optional
versioning or graph layers. V1 uses Ash's useful type taxonomy, centralized
secret rejection, temporal rewriting, and lifecycle/supersession discipline,
but does not copy Ash's sensitivity split, exact-content dedupe, or person
graph.

Future graph/entity/fact indexes should be derived from authoritative memory
records and source attribution. They can be added as separate rebuildable tables
without changing the V1 memory row's authority model.

External storage and retrieval assumptions are based on primary documentation:

- [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) for Postgres-native vector
  columns, exact nearest-neighbor search, and HNSW/IVFFlat indexes.
- [Neon pgvector docs](https://neon.com/docs/extensions/pgvector) because
  Junior's SQL adapter targets Neon-compatible Postgres.
- [Drizzle PostgreSQL extension docs](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/extensions/pg)
  for plugin-owned typed `vector` columns.
- [OpenAI embeddings docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)
  for current embedding model and dimension behavior.

## Plugin Shape

The V1 memory implementation is a trusted host plugin registered through
`defineJuniorPlugin({ manifest, hooks, tasks })`.

The plugin uses the package name and plugin name `memory`. Plugin database
tables use the prefix:

```txt
junior_memory_*
```

The V1 runtime plugin interface is:

```ts
defineJuniorPlugin({
  manifest,
  tasks: {
    processSession,
  },
  hooks: {
    userPrompt,
    tools,
  },
});
```

The exact hook names are owned by their generic plugin specs. The memory plugin
needs these broad V1 surfaces: automatic recall when the plugin is enabled,
completed-session background processing, model-visible memory tools, SQL
access, and host-owned model and embedding-provider access. A future admin CLI
surface is specified separately in [`./admin.md`](./admin.md).

Installations that do not want memory should disable the memory plugin rather
than split recall from the plugin. Future install-level memory policy may narrow
passive extraction, stored categories, providers, and retention defaults.

V1 passive extraction targets public/shareable, durable facts from the
completed run transcript for supported runtime contexts, including
user-authored messages and tool results. Extraction should prefer reusable
knowledge about how to achieve a result, such as stable source-of-truth,
workflow, query location, prerequisite, caveat, or decision-path knowledge.
Point-in-time answers from analytics, search, issue, metric, incident,
availability, or status queries are not memory unless the answer is stable
beyond the run. Local CLI contexts are valid passive-learning sources for
development and QA. Non-local sources must be `type: "pub"` and have a stable
runtime source key. Private, sensitive, secret, or otherwise restricted facts
are rejected rather than stored.

V1 uses the default extraction guidance in `policy.md`. Install-provided
extraction guidelines are out of scope for V1.

The plugin owns:

- its Drizzle table objects
- generated SQL migrations under `migrations/*.sql`
- a small memory store module around `ctx.db`
- extraction and retrieval policy
- memory policy guidance inside the memory agent
- passive extraction through a typed `session.completed` plugin task
- memory tool definitions
- future memory admin command definitions

Core owns:

- plugin loading and hook ordering
- prompt rendering and size limits
- database migration application
- runtime identity, source, and destination context
- model and embedding provider credential custody
- tool schema validation and tool execution boundaries
- plugin config loading
- log, trace, and dashboard redaction

## Memory Types

The plugin stores one `type` for lifecycle and rendering policy:

| Type           | Meaning                                            | Default TTL |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `preference`   | Stable user or conversation preference             | none        |
| `identity`     | Stable fact about the requester                    | none        |
| `relationship` | Stable fact about a named person or relationship   | none        |
| `knowledge`    | Durable project, workspace, or domain fact         | none        |
| `context`      | Current situation that should decay                | 7 days      |
| `event`        | Dated occurrence that may matter later             | 30 days     |
| `task`         | Remembered obligation that is not a scheduled task | 14 days     |
| `observation`  | Low-durability observation                         | 3 days      |

Explicit scheduled work belongs to the scheduler plugin, not memory. A memory
of type `task` is only a remembered fact unless the user explicitly creates a
scheduled task through the scheduler workflow.

V1 passive extraction must not create `identity` or `relationship` memories
about third parties. Those types are primarily for explicit personal memory,
such as the requester's own public/shareable preferences, identity facts, or
working relationships that pass policy.

## Scope Model

V1 supports two visibility scopes:

| Scope          | Stored authority                                | Visible to                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `personal`     | current requester actor                         | same requester in compatible runtime context               |
| `conversation` | source-derived conversation or public workspace | public Slack workspace, or same private/local conversation |

Rules:

1. Scope is derived from runtime context. Model-visible tool arguments never
   provide requester ids, team ids, channel ids, thread ids, or conversation ids.
2. Personal memory is the default for first-person facts in interactive
   requests.
   The current author/requester must be the subject of any personal-scoped
   identity, preference, or relationship fact. For example, `I am on the
billing team` may become a personal memory for that requester, while `David
is on the billing team` is not a valid personal memory when written by
   someone else.
3. Conversation memory may be created only when the user explicitly frames the
   fact as shared team/channel/conversation knowledge or the passive extractor
   can prove the fact is about the current conversation rather than a person.
4. Public Slack conversation memories are visible across the Slack workspace.
   Private Slack and local conversation memories do not recall across unrelated
   conversations, even if display names or Slack users appear to match.
5. Subject fields describe what the memory is about; they do not broaden
   visibility beyond the stored scope.
6. Stored content must not include ownership, source, or perspective labels
   such as `the requester`, `the user`, display names, `I`, `my`, `this
thread`, or channel labels. Those facts belong in structured scope, subject,
   and source fields; prompt rendering may add perspective later.

## Subject Model

Scope answers who can see the memory. Subject answers what the memory is about.
V1 supports a small subject model rather than a graph:

| Subject type   | Meaning                                      | Subject key                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `user`         | public/shareable fact about the current user | current requester actor key                       |
| `conversation` | norm or fact about the current conversation  | current source-derived conversation/workspace key |
| `general`      | project, product, repository, or domain fact | none                                              |

Rules:

1. `user` subject is allowed only for the current author/requester. V1 does not
   let one participant create another user's personal profile memory.
2. `conversation` subject is derived from the current runtime conversation.
3. `general` subject is for public/shareable operational or domain knowledge
   that is not primarily about a person or the conversation itself.
4. Subject keys are runtime-derived internal storage fields when present.
   Model-visible tool arguments cannot provide arbitrary user ids, actor ids,
   conversation ids, aliases, or display names as subjects.
5. Subject fields may be used for rendering, filtering, ranking, and future
   derived graph construction, but authorization still comes from scope.
6. Third-party operational facts may appear in conversation-scoped `general`
   memories when policy allows them, but V1 does not create `user` subject
   memories for third parties.

## Public-Only Content

V1 does not store a sensitivity, classification, or privacy label on memory
records. A memory is eligible only if the accepted content is safe to recall
inside its stored scope without special private/sensitive handling.

Rules:

1. `personal` scope means requester-owned visibility for public/shareable
   first-person memories authored by that requester. It does not mean the
   content may be private, sensitive, secret, or third-party profile data.
2. `conversation` scope means the memory may be recalled in the same
   conversation. It must be appropriate as shared conversation knowledge.
3. Secrets are rejected and never stored.
4. Sensitive or private personal facts are rejected in V1, including explicit
   user requests.
5. If Junior later supports non-public memory, it must add an intentional
   storage, retrieval, prompt, admin, export, and deletion contract. Existing V1
   rows can be deterministically treated as public/shareable rows.

## Store Boundary

Hook bodies must not issue ad hoc SQL directly. The plugin should keep storage
behind a small store such as `MemoryStore`.

The store boundary owns:

- parsing database rows into memory records
- rejecting invalid enum values and malformed rows
- visibility filtering
- create/archive/list operations
- extraction idempotency
- embedding row repair
- expiration and supersession updates

Drizzle table objects may be imported inside the plugin package. They must not
be exported as part of Junior core.

## Delivery Dependencies

The V1 contract has these implementation dependencies:

1. Core plugin surfaces needed by this spec: `userPrompt`, `session.completed`,
   `tools`, `ctx.db`, host model access, and host embedding provider access.
2. Memory plugin package with manifest, schema, migrations, store, and
   memory agent policy guidance.
3. Explicit `createMemory`, `listMemories`, `searchMemories`, and
   `removeMemory` tools with context-bound authority. `createMemory` submits a
   candidate memory; the memory agent uses the tool-hook model capability to
   own subject and scope decisions.
4. Automatic recall from stored memories through `userPrompt`, using lexical
   ranking before embeddings are available.
5. Embedding provider integration and vector storage.
6. `session.completed` passive extraction over completed agent-run sessions.
7. Deduplication, TTL archival, and conservative supersession.
8. Optional vector index tuning and hybrid ranking improvements.
9. Admin CLI inspection and repair commands after redaction and access
   rules are implemented.
10. Dashboard/admin UI only after a separate UI access-control contract exists.
