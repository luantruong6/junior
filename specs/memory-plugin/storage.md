## Purpose

Define the memory plugin's broad SQL storage design, embedding storage
mechanism, model-provider boundary, and operational rules without prescribing
exact migrations or DDL.

## Contracts

### Storage Ownership

The memory plugin owns its SQL schema, Drizzle table definitions, and packaged
migrations under [`../plugin-database.md`](../plugin-database.md).

This spec defines the shape and invariants those migrations must satisfy. It
does not define exact migration filenames, full column lists, or generated SQL.

### Data Classes

The plugin stores two classes of data:

1. **Memory records**: the durable source of truth for facts that may be
   recalled later.
2. **Retrieval indexes**: derived data, such as embeddings and lexical indexes,
   that can be deleted and rebuilt from memory records.

The implementation may use one table per class or split them further if needed.
The V1 authoritative storage shape is:

- one authoritative memory-record table
- no canonical graph/entity/fact tables

Embedding support adds one derived embedding/vector table or equivalent vector
index. Optional database-native lexical search support may be added as a
retrieval implementation detail.

### Memory Record Shape

Each memory record must contain enough information to enforce visibility and
lifecycle without consulting the original transcript.

Required conceptual fields:

- stable memory id
- self-contained memory content
- memory type
- runtime-derived visibility scope
- subject type
- runtime-derived subject key when the subject is a user or conversation
- runtime-derived source attribution
- completed-session or tool idempotency marker
- observed timestamp
- created timestamp
- optional expiration timestamp
- optional supersession link
- archive timestamp and reason

V1 intentionally keeps this authoritative row lean. Subject/display labels,
extraction confidence, and operational metadata should be added only with the
extraction, graph, or admin consumer that needs them.

Stored memory content must be canonical fact text, not perspective or
provenance text. Runtime ownership, subject, source, actor, thread, channel,
and requester identity belong in structured columns. They must not be baked
into the `content` prose.

Examples:

- Good: `Prefers terse PR summaries`
- Good: `Favorite CLI QA snack is mango chips`
- Good: `Deploy runbooks require staging checks first`
- Bad: `The requester prefers terse PR summaries`
- Bad: `David prefers terse PR summaries`
- Bad: `My favorite CLI QA snack is mango chips`
- Bad: `This thread says deploy runbooks require staging checks first`

Prompt rendering may add perspective at recall time. Storage must not.

Scope and source fields are authority-bearing. Subject fields describe the
memory's topic, but they must not grant visibility beyond scope. The stored
subject key is runtime-derived internal metadata, not model-visible tool input
or ordinary memory output. Display labels, model-generated summaries, and tool
arguments are not authorities.

V1 stores only public/shareable memory content, so the authoritative row must
not include a dormant sensitivity or classification column. If a future feature
supports non-public memory, it must add a new end-to-end contract; existing V1
rows can be backfilled or interpreted as public/shareable without semantic
recategorization.

### Derived Graph Data

Graph/entity/fact storage is out of scope for V1. Prior-art systems that use a
graph still treat episodes, passages, or memory items as the source from which
graph edges are derived.

If Junior later needs entity linking, relationship retrieval, or multi-hop
recall, it should add separate derived graph tables keyed by memory id and
source attribution. Those tables must be rebuildable from authoritative memory
records plus bounded source references. Graph nodes, aliases, display labels,
and model-extracted entity subjects must not become authorization principals.

### Visibility Data

The storage model must support these V1 visibility scopes:

- personal memory owned by the current requester identity
- conversation memory owned by the current public Slack workspace or
  private/local source conversation

The stored scope must be derived from runtime context before write. Model-visible
tool input cannot provide requester ids, actor ids, workspace ids, channel ids,
thread ids, or arbitrary conversation ids.

The store must be able to filter active visible records by:

- scope
- plugin-derived subject type
- future install policy, when that policy surface exists
- archive state
- supersession state
- expiration

### Idempotency And Duplicates

Passive extraction must be idempotent across repeated completed-session task
scheduling, queue redelivery, and task retry. The store needs a stable source
marker for a completed session and each extracted fact.

Semantic duplicate suppression needs extractor and retrieval context. It runs
before insertion in memory creation paths that have memory agent review, but V1
storage does not use exact-content hashing as memory identity.

### Lexical Search

Lexical search is required because embeddings are optional operationally and can
fail independently of memory writes.

The storage layer should use Postgres-native text search or an equivalent SQL
indexable mechanism. Retrieval must still apply the memory visibility predicate
before returning rows to prompt rendering or tools.

### Embedding Storage

Embeddings are derived retrieval data. They are not the authority for memory
existence, visibility, or deletion.

When embeddings are enabled, embedding rows or index entries must
record:

- memory id
- provider id
- model id
- dimensions
- distance metric
- content hash that was embedded
- vector value
- created/repaired timestamps

The plugin should not store raw embedding-provider request or response payloads.

Changing provider, model, dimensions, or metric requires re-embedding active
memories. Missing or stale embeddings degrade retrieval to lexical and recency
ranking.

Vectors inherit the scope, retention, deletion, and provider policy of their
source memory. Archiving or deleting a memory must remove or invalidate derived
vectors under the same rules as the memory content.

### Vector Storage

V1 uses Postgres-native vector storage through pgvector when embeddings are
enabled. The storage profile is fixed at `vector(1536)` with cosine distance.

Use cosine distance by default. `text-embedding-3-small` at 1536 dimensions is
the expected fallback because it fits a common pgvector setup and matches the
Ash prototype's default. The embedding model must still be deployment
configurable through the host provider boundary, following the same
Gateway-model configuration pattern as other Junior model roles. The configured
model must return 1536 dimensions for the v1 vector table. Larger native
embedding models require a new derived embedding storage version plus a rebuild
plan; they must not force changes to authoritative memory rows.

### Vector Index Strategy

The retrieval design should not assume approximate vector indexes are necessary
on day one.

V1 should start with exact vector ranking over visible active candidates. If
production data shows that exact ranking is too slow, add an approximate
pgvector index such as HNSW and overfetch results before applying exact
visibility filtering and final reranking.

Approximate vector search is a performance tool, not an authorization boundary.

### Embedding Provider

Core must keep provider credentials and expose only a narrow host capability to
plugin hooks and tasks:

```ts
interface PluginEmbeddingProvider {
  embedTexts(input: { texts: string[] }): Promise<{
    provider: string;
    model: string;
    dimensions: number;
    vectors: number[][];
  }>;
}
```

Rules:

1. The provider is host runtime code, not a model-visible tool.
2. The memory plugin never receives provider API keys.
3. The returned vector count must equal the input text count.
4. Empty or whitespace-only texts are rejected before provider calls.
5. The returned dimensions must match the configured vector storage.
6. Provider failures do not roll back accepted memory content.
7. Missing embeddings degrade recall to lexical and recency ranking.

The default embedding configuration should be:

```txt
provider = openai-compatible
model = text-embedding-3-small
storage_dimensions = 1536
metric = cosine
```

The exact provider name and model id are deployment configuration. The storage
dimension is not a v1 deployment knob. Stored embedding metadata records the
resolved provider and model used for each vector so derived rows can be skipped
or rebuilt when the model no longer matches the storage profile.

### Write Path

Memory creation follows this order:

1. Validate content shape, runtime-derived scope/source, expiration, and
   metadata.
2. Run memory agent review before write paths that originate from model or
   extractor decisions.
3. Run deterministic structural validation for schemas, authority fields,
   lifecycle bounds, idempotency, and storage constraints.
4. Insert the memory record transactionally.
5. After the transaction commits, batch-generate embeddings for inserted records
   when an embedding provider is configured.
6. Store or repair vector data only when provider output matches the configured
   vector storage.

Provider calls must not run inside the SQL transaction.

If embedding generation fails, the memory remains active and can be found
through lexical/list retrieval. A later embedding repair task may repair missing
or stale embeddings.

If future install policy disables embeddings or a provider for a scope, the
write path must skip vector generation without failing the memory write.

### Repair And Rebuild

Embedding repair should run through plugin background work rather than request
handlers.

The repair task finds active memories where:

- no vector exists
- the vector was generated from an old content hash
- provider/model/dimensions differ from current config

It processes bounded batches and is idempotent.

### Removal And Lifecycle

Memory removal archives in place:

- set archive timestamp and reason
- exclude from recall and normal list results
- delete or ignore derived embedding/vector data

Physical deletion is reserved for future retention, export, and account
deletion workflows.

Memory maintenance must archive:

- memories whose expiration is in the past
- ephemeral memories older than their type default TTL
- superseded memories after the supersession marker is committed

V1 may perform this maintenance opportunistically during create, list, recall,
remove, extraction, and embedding repair paths. A future low-frequency
maintenance task may be specified separately if opportunistic cleanup is
insufficient.
