## Purpose

Define the explicit model-visible memory management and recall tools exposed by
the memory plugin.

Operator/admin memory commands are covered by [`./admin.md`](./admin.md). They
must not be exposed through this model-visible tool surface.

## Tool Surface

The plugin exposes memory tools from `tools(ctx)`:

```txt
createMemory
removeMemory
listMemories
searchMemories
```

Tool schemas must be context-bound. All tools derive requester, source,
destination, conversation, and tenant/workspace authority from runtime context.

### createMemory

`createMemory` may accept:

- content
- optional `expires_at` expiration selector: exact ISO timestamp, or the
  literal `never` for memories with no expiration. Omission also means no
  expiration.

`createMemory` must not accept:

- requester id
- actor id
- Slack team id
- Slack channel id
- Slack thread timestamp
- arbitrary conversation id
- arbitrary owner id
- arbitrary scope enum
- arbitrary subject id
- arbitrary subject display name
- arbitrary subject enum
- raw source metadata

The tool submits one public/shareable memory candidate. The candidate content
must be self-contained natural-language text, such as `I prefer terse status
updates`, while vague references like `remember this` are invalid. The outer
agent provides the candidate text; it does not select storage scope, subject,
or canonical stored content.

Ordinary technical, workflow, communication, tool, language, product,
repository, or project preferences and opinions are valid candidates when the
current requester explicitly asks Junior to remember them. The outer agent
should call `createMemory` for those requests instead of asking the requester
to rephrase them as safer memory text. The memory agent owns the semantic
store-or-reject decision and canonical rewrite.

The outer agent should not call `createMemory` for ordinary organic statements
that merely reveal a durable task, process, project, channel, or operational
fact. Those are passive-learning candidates handled by completed-session
processing, not explicit memory-tool requests. Organic first-person personal
facts should be stored passively only when they are clearly durable and useful
beyond the active task.

The explicit tool path uses runtime context for source and idempotency. It must
run through the memory agent's explicit-create review path. The memory agent
decides store/reject, memory kind, and canonical perspective-neutral content.
The plugin derives the storage target from the reviewed kind: requester for
`preference`, conversation for `procedure` and `fact`.

The model cannot provide arbitrary scope enums, subject ids, Slack user ids,
display names, aliases, or subject classes.

Content eligibility is an agentic policy decision, not a deterministic regex
classifier. The fact that a user explicitly asked Junior to remember something
can satisfy the "explicit request" category, but it must not bypass:

- secret rejection by the memory agent
- source and scope rules
- workplace-sensitive category rejection by the memory agent
- public-content restrictions
- provider and embedding policy
- retention and lifecycle policy

If policy rejects an explicit memory request, the tool should return a
model-visible input error that explains the rejection at a high level without
echoing sensitive content.

If memory agent review is unavailable or returns malformed output, the tool
must fail closed and must not write the candidate.

### removeMemory

`removeMemory` accepts a memory id or short id prefix and archives only a memory
visible in the current context.

Ambiguous short prefixes must fail with a model-visible input error rather than
removing multiple rows.

### listMemories

`listMemories` lists only active memories visible in the current context. It
may accept an optional limit, but it must not search across unrelated users or
conversations. Future install policy must be applied before returning results
when that policy surface exists.

The tool may include ids or short ids because explicit removal workflows need a
handle. Normal automatic memory injection should avoid ids.

### searchMemories

`searchMemories` is the model-visible targeted recall path for cases where the
model needs a more specific lookup than automatic recall supplied.

`searchMemories` may accept:

- query text
- optional limit

`searchMemories` must not accept:

- requester id
- actor id
- Slack team id
- Slack channel id
- Slack thread timestamp
- arbitrary conversation id
- arbitrary owner id
- arbitrary scope override

The tool derives visible scopes from runtime context, applies current install
policy, and runs the same retrieval pipeline as automatic memory injection.
Results must be active, visible, policy-allowed memories only.

Unlike `listMemories`, `searchMemories` is relevance-ranked and does not need
to return every visible memory. It may omit ids unless the model needs a handle
for a follow-up `removeMemory` request.

## Output Rules

Tool output must be concise and must not reveal hidden private metadata. For
private conversations, tool output may contain memory content because it is
model-visible response context, but logs/traces/reporting for that tool must
redact content according to [`../data-redaction-policy.md`](../data-redaction-policy.md).
