## Purpose

Define the explicit model-visible memory management and recall tools exposed by
the memory plugin.

Operator/admin memory commands are covered by [`./admin.md`](./admin.md). They
must not be exposed through this model-visible tool surface.

## Tool Surface

The plugin exposes memory tools from `tools(ctx)`:

```txt
createMemory
removeMemory
listMemories
searchMemories
```

Tool schemas must be context-bound. All tools derive requester, source,
destination, conversation, and tenant/workspace authority from runtime context.

### createMemory

`createMemory` may accept:

- content
- optional scope enum: `personal` or `conversation`
- optional expiration duration/date
- optional sensitivity hint

`createMemory` must not accept:

- requester id
- actor id
- Slack team id
- Slack channel id
- Slack thread timestamp
- arbitrary conversation id
- arbitrary owner id
- raw source metadata

The tool derives source, requester, destination, and scope from runtime context.
It runs the same validation, secret rejection, duplicate checks, and embedding
write path as passive extraction. Explicit tool requests are still subject to
install-level memory policy.

`createMemory` must run the same deterministic policy filter as passive
extraction before writing. The fact that a user explicitly asked Junior to
remember something can satisfy the "explicit request" category, but it must not
bypass:

- secret rejection
- source and scope rules
- workplace-sensitive category rejection
- sensitivity restrictions
- provider and embedding policy
- retention and lifecycle policy

If policy rejects an explicit memory request, the tool should return a
model-visible input error that explains the rejection at a high level without
echoing sensitive content.

### removeMemory

`removeMemory` accepts a memory id or short id prefix and archives only a memory
visible in the current context.

Ambiguous short prefixes must fail with a model-visible input error rather than
removing multiple rows.

### listMemories

`listMemories` lists only active memories visible in the current context. It
may accept an optional limit, but it must not search across unrelated users or
conversations. Current install policy must be applied before returning results.

The tool may include ids or short ids because explicit removal workflows need a
handle. Normal automatic memory injection should avoid ids.

### searchMemories

`searchMemories` is the model-visible recall path when automatic memory
injection is disabled, and it can supplement automatic recall when the model
needs a targeted lookup.

`searchMemories` may accept:

- query text
- optional limit

`searchMemories` must not accept:

- requester id
- actor id
- Slack team id
- Slack channel id
- Slack thread timestamp
- arbitrary conversation id
- arbitrary owner id
- arbitrary scope override

The tool derives visible scopes from runtime context, applies current install
policy, and runs the same retrieval pipeline as automatic memory injection.
Results must be active, visible, policy-allowed memories only.

Unlike `listMemories`, `searchMemories` is relevance-ranked and does not need
to return every visible memory. It may omit ids unless the model needs a handle
for a follow-up `removeMemory` request.

## Output Rules

Tool output must be concise and must not reveal hidden private metadata. For
private conversations, tool output may contain memory content because it is
model-visible response context, but logs/traces/reporting for that tool must
redact content according to [`../data-redaction-policy.md`](../data-redaction-policy.md).
