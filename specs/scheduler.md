## Purpose

Define the first scheduler contract for Junior: users can create durable tasks that Junior executes later or repeatedly, with explicit task framing and delivery back to the configured surface.

## Scope

- Scheduled task and scheduled run data model.
- Prompt envelope used when executing a scheduled task.
- Storage and idempotency rules.
- Slack authoring and management behavior.
- Verification layer responsibilities.

## Non-Goals

- A generic event-rule engine for GitHub, Slack, Sentry, or webhook events.
- SQL-backed storage as a V1 requirement.
- A full durable workflow runtime such as Temporal or Vercel Workflow.
- Reusing timeout-resume callbacks as the product scheduler.
- Slack `chat.scheduleMessage` as the execution mechanism.

## Contracts

### Product Boundary

A scheduled task is not a stored Slack message. It is a normalized task contract that Junior executes on a time trigger.

The stored task must include:

- task text
- creator metadata
- execution actor metadata
- conversation access metadata
- optional credential subject for private direct conversations
- destination surface
- schedule and timezone
- current status
- next-run timestamp when active
- recurrence rule when recurring
- optional constraints and source context

The original user utterance may be retained for audit/debugging, but it must not be the sole execution input.

Slack destinations are conversations, not existing threads. A scheduled task may target the active Slack DM or channel, and scheduled output posts as a new message in that conversation.
Each scheduled execution gets fresh dispatch-scoped conversation state. The runner must not load destination-level Slack conversation history as prior thread context for a scheduled run that is creating its own new message.

The scheduler must distinguish conversation audience from visibility. A private direct conversation may attach an explicit user credential subject for scheduled tools; that subject may satisfy stored user OAuth lookup, but the scheduled run still executes as the system actor. A private group conversation or private channel is still multi-user and must not implicitly use one user's credentials. Unknown privacy or audience must fail closed for delegated user credentials.

Creator metadata records the user who confirmed the task so Junior can audit changes and privately notify someone when the task needs attention. The creator is not an owner, is not an authorization principal, and is not the actor for future scheduled runs.

Task management is controlled only by access to the destination conversation window. If a user can post or trigger Junior in that Slack DM or channel context, they can manage scheduled tasks for that same context. The scheduler must not add creator-only, owner-only, workspace-admin-only, or channel-admin-only gates for V1 management.

### Calendar Model

Every active task must have an exact `nextRunAtMs` instant. For one-off tasks, that instant is the complete schedule.
Slack authoring may accept supported relative one-off phrases such as "tomorrow at 9am"; these must be resolved to an exact `nextRunAtMs` before storage. When a user does not provide a timezone, scheduler authoring defaults to `America/Los_Angeles` unless `JUNIOR_TIMEZONE` overrides it.
Scheduler tools accept exact ISO run timestamps only. Natural-language or relative time belongs in the agent's interpretation step before it calls the tool, not in the storage tool contract.

Model-facing scheduler tools use a small recurrence input: omit recurrence for one-off tasks, pass `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, or `yearly` for recurring tasks, and pass `null` only when updating an existing task to one-off. The scheduler derives stored calendar fields such as local start date, local time, weekday, month, and day-of-month from `nextRunAtMs` and timezone.

Recurring tasks must also store a small calendar recurrence rule:

- frequency: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, or `yearly`
- positive interval
- local start date
- local time
- timezone
- optional weekly weekdays
- optional monthly/yearly exact day-of-month and month

V1 recurrence is calendar-based, not fixed-duration. For example, "every Monday at 9am America/Los_Angeles" should continue to run at 9am local time across daylight-saving changes. Monthly and yearly recurrences use exact calendar dates; unsupported dates are skipped rather than converted into "last day" or "business day" behavior.

Recurring tasks must not run more than once per day. Slack authoring must reject hourly, twice-daily, or other sub-daily recurring schedules instead of storing a task contract that cannot execute as requested. Rejected scheduler tool calls must throw a model-visible tool input error so the agent can repair arguments or explain the unsupported request after receiving an `isError=true` tool result.

The scheduler does not need advanced rules such as first business day, nearest weekday, holiday calendars, or arbitrary cron syntax.

Run-now has a separate contract:

1. Run-now applies only to active tasks.
2. Run-now must not implicitly resume paused or blocked tasks.
3. Run-now must not rewrite the task's stored calendar schedule.
4. A task may store a separate immediate-run timestamp.
5. When both the immediate-run timestamp and ordinary `nextRunAtMs` are due, the scheduler claims the immediate run first.
6. After the manual run reaches a terminal state, clear the immediate-run timestamp.
7. If the ordinary `nextRunAtMs` was already overdue when the manual run completed, consume that scheduled occurrence and advance recurrence once instead of running the same task twice in one tick.

### Missed Run Policy

The scheduler must not execute arbitrarily old work just because heartbeat delivery or dispatch recovery was broken. At claim time, any scheduled occurrence more than 24 hours older than the scheduler's current clock is stale.

Stale occurrences are terminal skipped runs:

1. The scheduler records a run for the missed `task_id:scheduled_for_ms` with `status: skipped`.
2. The scheduler must not dispatch the agent for that occurrence.
3. A skipped stale occurrence does not update `lastRunAtMs`, because no task execution happened.
4. A one-off stale occurrence is consumed: the task becomes `paused` with no `nextRunAtMs`.
5. A recurring stale occurrence is consumed and the task advances directly to the next future recurrence. The scheduler must not run catch-up loops for every missed recurrence.
6. A stale run-now request is cleared without shifting the stored ordinary schedule.
7. During stale recovery, an equivalent newer active task in the same destination should be skipped and paused when an older active task with the same schedule and task contract remains canonical.
8. Staleness is not a blocked or missing-input state and must not require human review. A user can still run the task manually if the missed work is still useful.

### Prompt Framing

Every scheduled run must compile the stored task into a marker-delimited prompt before entering the agent runtime.

The prompt must make these facts explicit:

1. This is an autonomous scheduled run.
2. The task contract is the source of truth for what to execute.
3. The run executes as a Junior system actor, not as the user who created the task.
4. The run should complete without asking follow-up questions unless access, approval, or required input is missing.
5. If blocked, the result should identify the missing provider, permission, or input.

The compiled prompt must separate descriptive task facts from directives. Use marker blocks such as:

- `<scheduled-task-run>`
- `<scheduled-task>`
- `<run-context>`
- `<execution-rules>`
- `<current-instruction priority="highest">`

This follows the router and turn-context pattern: background and state live in descriptive blocks, while behavior rules live in a rules block and the actual ask appears last.

### Storage

V1 must not require SQL. The scheduler store should use the existing durable state dependency already required by Junior deployments.

The initial implementation may use the Chat SDK state adapter and a global task index:

- `junior:scheduler:task:{task_id}` stores the task record.
- `junior:scheduler:tasks` stores task ids for due scans.
- `junior:scheduler:team:{team_id}:tasks` stores task ids for workspace management.
- `junior:scheduler:run:{run_id}` stores run history.
- `junior:scheduler:active:{task_id}` stores the currently active run marker for task-level overlap prevention.
- `junior:scheduler:claim:{task_id}:{scheduled_for_ms}` is the idempotency claim.

### Run Idempotency

Scheduled execution is at-least-once at the trigger layer and exactly-once-best-effort at Junior's run layer.

Rules:

1. A run idempotency key is `task_id:scheduled_for_ms`.
2. The scheduler must claim that key before dispatch.
3. Duplicate ticks and retries must not dispatch the same scheduled run more than once.
4. Run side effects must be keyed by the scheduled run id where possible.
5. V1 tasks do not overlap with themselves. If a task already has an active run, later due claims for that same task are not dispatched.
6. Stale pending claims may be reclaimed after the scheduler's stale-claim timeout.

### Plugin Heartbeat Flow

The scheduler plugin uses two trusted hooks:

1. `tools(ctx)` for interactive schedule management.
2. `heartbeat(ctx)` for due-run discovery and dispatch.

Heartbeat flow:

1. Load due tasks from the scheduler plugin's namespaced state.
2. Reconcile previously dispatched runs with `ctx.agent.get(dispatchId)`.
3. Claim up to a small limit of due runs.
4. Mark each claimed run as pending dispatch.
5. Call `ctx.agent.dispatch(...)` once per claimed run.
6. Store the returned dispatch id on the run record.
7. Leave remaining due work for a later heartbeat.

The scheduler heartbeat must not execute scheduled tasks inline. It only claims and dispatches bounded work.

If `ctx.agent.get(dispatchId)` returns `undefined` for a non-terminal scheduler run, the scheduler treats the core dispatch record as expired or missing. It may mark the run failed with an expiration error, or reclaim and redispatch only when its own run policy says that is safe. The scheduler must eventually transition the run to a terminal state or create a new redispatch attempt.

Dispatch call for a scheduled run:

```ts
await ctx.agent.dispatch({
  idempotencyKey: run.id,
  destination: task.destination,
  input: buildScheduledTaskRunPrompt({ task, run, nowMs }),
  metadata: {
    taskId: task.id,
    runId: run.id,
  },
});
```

Scheduler run state must represent:

- due task
- claimed run
- pending dispatch
- dispatched
- running
- completed
- failed
- blocked
- skipped

Additional scheduler plugin invariants:

1. Dispatch success records the core dispatch id.
2. Duplicate dispatch attempts use the same idempotency key.
3. Duplicate internal callbacks do not execute the same run twice.
4. Stale pending-dispatch records are reclaimable by a later heartbeat.
5. Stale running records are reclaimable according to scheduler policy.
6. Scheduler tools derive destination from the active conversation context.
7. Users cannot create scheduled DMs for other users.
8. Existing Slack threads are never stored as task destinations.

### Actor And Auth Model

Scheduled tasks must distinguish these V1 identities:

- **Creator:** the human who confirmed the task. This is audit and notification metadata only.
- **Conversation manager:** any user who can post or trigger Junior in the destination Slack conversation window. This controls who may list, pause, resume, delete, or run-now the task for that same conversation.
- **Execution actor:** the actor used for the autonomous scheduled run. For scheduled tasks, this is a Junior system actor, not a Slack user.

Scheduled runs must not pass the creator as the runtime requester or treat the creator as if they were present and acting during the run. Audit and correlation metadata should include both the system execution actor and creator metadata. Auth decisions must use the execution actor unless the task stores an explicit credential subject allowed by the private direct conversation exception below.

V1 scheduled execution has no user requester. User OAuth tokens cannot be used merely because that user created the task. Authorization flows are disabled during scheduled runs, and authorization links must not be posted publicly. If no usable system credential or explicit credential subject exists, Junior must block the run and privately notify the creator when possible.

The scheduler chooses the execution actor and forwards explicit credential subjects; it does not encode provider-specific permission policy. Agent runtime and provider brokers own the credential envelope for the current actor, such as safe read-only GitHub App credentials for system actors.

Exception: a scheduled task created in a private direct conversation may store an explicit credential subject for the requester who created the task. This subject is not the execution actor and does not make the creator the requester for the scheduled run. It is only an auth subject that lets credential resolution use that user's already-connected provider credentials during autonomous execution. The exception requires both:

- `conversationAccess.audience = direct`
- `conversationAccess.visibility = private`

Private group conversations, private channels, public channels, and unknown conversation access must not store or use user credential subjects for scheduled runs.

Credential subjects may include:

- system-owned credentials available to the scheduled-run actor
- an explicitly recorded delegated credential subject in the task contract
- a supported service principal named by the task contract

Credential subjects must be explicit and separate from creator metadata.

### Slack UX

Slack authoring creates clear scheduled-work requests immediately for the active destination:

1. User asks Junior to schedule work.
2. Junior normalizes the task text, cadence, timezone, destination, and next run.
3. If the task text, schedule, and active destination are clear, Junior creates the task immediately.
4. If the task text, schedule, or active destination is ambiguous, Junior asks for confirmation or clarification before creating the task.
5. Junior replies with the task id, destination, schedule, timezone, and next run after creation.
6. Junior supports list, pause, resume, delete, and run-now commands from the destination conversation.

Confirmation should show the executable task text, not only echo the user's text.
Anyone who can post or trigger Junior in the destination Slack conversation window may manage that conversation's scheduled tasks. Creator identity remains audit and notification metadata, but it is not an edit/delete/run-now ownership gate and is not the execution actor.
Task creation must use the current active Slack conversation as the destination. Users cannot create scheduled tasks for a different channel, and cannot create DMs for other users.
List output must be scoped to the active destination conversation and must not reveal tasks from other channels or DMs in the same workspace.
Blocked tasks must appear in list output with their blocked reason. After the missing requirement is fixed, a conversation manager can resume the task or run it now from the same destination conversation.

## Failure Model

1. Tick delivery fails: the task remains due and a later tick may claim it.
2. Duplicate tick delivery: the run claim suppresses duplicate dispatch.
3. Run fails after claim: run record captures failure and retry policy decides whether to re-dispatch.
4. Required non-user credentials are missing: mark the run blocked, keep or pause the task according to policy, and privately notify the creator when possible.
5. A task remains due for more than 24 hours: mark that occurrence skipped, then consume or advance the task according to the missed-run policy.
6. Prompt framing is ambiguous: evals must catch cases where the model creates/edits a schedule instead of executing the task.

## Observability

Scheduler execution should emit safe task/run metadata only:

- task id
- run id
- scheduled timestamp
- task status
- run status
- destination platform and channel id
- execution actor type and id
- creator Slack user id, when available

Logs and spans must not include OAuth tokens, provider credentials, raw authorization URLs, or private tool payloads.

## Verification

Use evals for model-dependent behavior:

- natural-language schedule extraction
- task framing quality
- confirmation quality
- scheduled-run execution behavior
- not confusing scheduled execution with schedule creation

Use integration tests for runtime/storage contracts that do not depend on model interpretation:

- due claim idempotency
- stale one-off, recurring, and run-now occurrences skip without dispatch
- stale recovery dedupes equivalent active tasks in the same destination
- blocked auth path for missing non-user credentials
- scheduled runner passes a system actor rather than the creator as requester
- user OAuth tokens are not used implicitly for scheduled tasks
- private direct scheduled tasks may carry an explicit user credential subject
- private group/channel scheduled tasks do not carry user credential subjects
- dispatch to Slack delivery
- destination-scoped list output
- conversation-access management for pause, resume, delete, and run-now

Use unit tests only for small deterministic helpers when integration or eval coverage would be wasteful.
