# Security Policy

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- Host runtime code (`packages/junior/src/chat/**`, `packages/junior/app/**`, `packages/junior/scripts/**`).
- Sandbox/container execution paths.
- External provider credentials and token issuance.
- Skill execution and capability-gated access.
- Logging, tracing, and operational incident handling.

## Security principles

- Least privilege.
- Short-lived credentials over long-lived credentials.
- Isolate untrusted execution.
- Keep secrets out of logs and repository history.

## Runtime and sandbox policy

### Container and sandbox isolation

- User-influenced command execution must run in sandboxed environments.
- Sandbox filesystem is treated as ephemeral/untrusted.

### Sandbox network policy

- Production should use explicit network policy and minimal allowlists.
- Credential-capable provider domains should route through the Junior sandbox egress proxy instead of receiving long-lived sandbox secrets.
- Proxied sandbox egress requests must verify the Vercel-signed Sandbox OIDC token, use its sandbox claim as the active VM session id, resolve the provider from the Vercel forwarded host/path headers, and require a signed credential-context token in the forwarding route that matches the OIDC sandbox claim. Cached provider leases must be scoped to one credential/sandbox context and lease expiry.
- The egress handler must verify Vercel Sandbox OIDC before returning configuration, provider, or session-specific responses.
- The egress proxy must not reject duplicate method/URL/body requests as replay; duplicate request shapes can be legitimate retries. Credential-context-bound issuance is the security boundary.

### Harness-owned tool targeting

- For context-bound tools, destination/target resolution is owned by the runtime harness, not model-supplied tool arguments.
- Tool schemas must not expose destination override fields for context-bound operations unless explicitly approved by spec.
- When required context is missing, tools must fail safely with structured errors; they must not silently choose alternate/private scopes.
- Shared deliverables must not fall back to bot-private artifacts.
- See [Harness Tool Context Spec](./harness-tool-context.md).

## Credential and token policy

### Secret custody

- Long-lived provider secrets stay in host-managed secret storage.
- Never commit long-lived secrets into repository files.
- Never write long-lived secrets into skill directories.

### Issuance and injection

- Runtime issues short-lived provider credentials when sandbox traffic reaches a registered provider domain.
- Registered plugin provider declarations determine which provider credentials may be injected for matching forwarded provider domains.
- A registered provider authorizes its declared domains for sandbox egress; registration must not mint credentials by itself.
- Credential issuance for user-owned provider access must be bound to a credential context with a user actor or explicit user subject; runtime paths without credential context must fail instead of issuing reusable credentials.
- Even for host-managed integrations, sandbox credentials are issued lazily only when a sandbox request reaches a declared provider domain. The runtime must not pre-provision provider credentials merely because a plugin is loaded or a command might need auth.
- Real provider secrets are delivered exclusively via host-level header transforms — the host proxies auth headers for matching provider domains (e.g. `Authorization` for `api.github.com`/`us.sentry.io` or provider-specific API key headers). The sandbox never sees real secret values.
- When CLI tools require tool-native sandbox auth env vars (for example `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, Pup's `DD_API_KEY`, or Pup's `DD_APP_KEY`), set them to non-secret placeholders so the tool proceeds to make HTTP requests. Placeholder values may be provider-specific via plugin manifest config. The host authenticates those requests via header transforms.
- Plugin-declared command env may include placeholders, default-backed deployment values, and host env bindings explicitly marked safe for sandbox exposure. It must not read or expose env vars used by API headers, credential config, OAuth config, or other host-only secret deployment values.
- Never inject real provider secrets into sandbox env vars, files, or command arguments.

### GitHub baseline

- Use GitHub App installation auth.
- Keep `GITHUB_APP_ID` and `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` on host only.
- Sign App JWT on host, then exchange for installation token.
- Require `GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID` for deterministic installation selection.
- For system actors, request an explicit read-only installation-token permission body. Use GitHub App `credentials.system-read-permissions` when configured, otherwise derive the safe default read subset from the installation permissions.
- Configure `GITHUB_APP_BOT_NAME` and `GITHUB_APP_BOT_EMAIL` as host env vars.
  They are public git author metadata, not credentials.
- Declare both `api.github.com` and `github.com` in the GitHub plugin manifest
  so the egress proxy forwards REST API and git HTTPS traffic through
  host-managed credential transforms.
- Disable git credential helpers in sandbox env (`GIT_ASKPASS`, `credential.helper=`) so git never sends its own auth — the proxy header transform is the sole credential source.
- Set `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`, `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`, and
  `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` from the configured GitHub App bot identity so
  sandbox commits are attributed to the installation bot, not a user named
  like the app slug.
- Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in lease env to a placeholder — real token never enters the sandbox.
- Keep explicit `--repo owner/repo` and remote targets for command correctness and wrong-repo protection; they are not a credential-scoping boundary.

### OAuth authorization link privacy

- Authorization URLs contain user-specific CSRF state tokens and must **only** be visible to the requesting user.
- Deliver authorization links via Slack `chat.postEphemeral` (channels) or `chat.postMessage` in 1:1 DMs (where the conversation is already private).
- If private delivery fails, fall back to a DM to the user — **never** post an authorization URL as a visible message in a channel or group conversation.
- Visible Slack thread acknowledgements may say that authorization is needed and that a private link was sent, but must not include the authorization URL.
- The agent must **never** receive or relay raw authorization URLs. If private delivery fails entirely, return an error instructing the user to DM the bot.

### Sentry baseline

- Use per-user OAuth tokens via Authorization Code Grant (RFC 6749 §4.1).
- Tokens are per Slack user ID, stored via `UserTokenStore` interface (Redis-backed `StateAdapterTokenStore`).
- Keep `SENTRY_CLIENT_SECRET` on host only.
- Token exchange and storage happen server-side in the OAuth callback handler — the agent never sees token values.
- Refresh tokens on host, deliver short-lived access tokens via header transforms.
- Fall back to static `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` env var only for local/dev/test paths outside credential-context-bound turn execution.
- Inject `Authorization` header transforms for Sentry region API domains such as `us.sentry.io` and `de.sentry.io`.
- Set `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in lease env to a placeholder — real token never enters the sandbox.
- See [OAuth Flows Spec](./oauth-flows.md) for full flow details.

## Logging and redaction policy

- Never log token values, private keys, or raw Authorization headers.
- Log only safe metadata (skill, capability, target, outcome, expiry timestamp).
- Conversation, model, and tool payload redaction is governed by
  `./data-redaction-policy.md`; private conversations must not expose raw
  message text, thinking output, tool arguments, or tool results in logs,
  traces, or dashboard APIs.

## Verification requirements

Privileged changes should verify:

- successful automatic injection path
- failed issuance path
- lease expiry/refresh behavior
- no secret values in logs

## Incident response

If credential leakage is suspected:

1. Rotate affected long-lived secrets.
2. Revoke active short-lived tokens where possible.
3. Audit impact window in logs/traces.
4. Patch and re-verify.

## Policy ownership

- Runtime maintainers own this policy.
