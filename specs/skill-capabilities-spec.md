## Purpose

Define how Junior maps a loaded plugin-backed skill to host-managed credentials without exposing secrets or manual auth commands to the model.

## Core model

1. Plugins own provider permissions in `plugin.yaml`.
2. Skills do not declare capabilities or config keys.
3. After a plugin-backed skill is loaded, the agent runs the real provider command.
4. The runtime resolves the provider from the active skill, issues a provider lease, and injects credentials for the current turn only.
5. If auth is missing or stale, the runtime starts a private OAuth flow and resumes the paused turn after authorization.
6. Plugin manifests own runtime setup. Skills do not instruct the agent to install packages, bootstrap CLIs, configure provider credentials, command env, or MCP servers.

## Plugin contract

Plugins define:

- `capabilities`: host-side permission manifest for the provider integration
- `credentials`: how runtime leases are delivered to tools
- `command-env`: non-secret env vars or placeholders needed by sandbox commands
- `oauth`: optional per-user OAuth configuration
- `target`: optional provider-default metadata such as a repo config key

Capabilities remain a host-side permission description. They are not a model-facing command surface.

## Skill contract

Plugin-backed skills may declare normal skill metadata:

```yaml
---
name: github
description: Create and update GitHub issues.
---
```

Rules:

- `uses-config` is no longer supported. Config keys are owned by the parent plugin manifest and exposed through the provider catalog.
- `requires-capabilities` is no longer supported.
- Skills must never include secret values.
- Skills should use provider defaults from the runtime provider catalog so repo/project commands stay deterministic.
- Skills must treat plugin-provided commands, tools, and command env as already available. Missing CLIs, missing MCP tools, sandbox package failures, missing command env, or missing credentials are runtime/plugin setup failures to report or reconnect through runtime-owned flows, not problems for the skill to repair with package-manager or credential setup commands.

## Runtime contract

### Lease issuance

- Resolve provider from `activeSkill.pluginProvider`.
- Require requester context before issuing provider credentials.
- Return short-lived leases only.
- Keep lease reuse in memory only, keyed by provider for the active turn.

### Injection behavior

- Enablement happens when the authenticated provider command runs, not at skill-load time.
- Delivery uses sandbox header transforms for matching domains.
- Plugin credentials may define a provider-specific `auth-token-placeholder` for CLI compatibility.
- Plugin manifests may define non-secret `command-env` values for CLI compatibility. These may include placeholder API keys or deployment defaults, but never real secrets.
- Do not inject long-lived secrets into sandbox files.

### Runtime setup boundary

- Loaded plugin-backed skills include a host-owned boundary derived from the plugin manifest before the skill body.
- `loadSkill` re-resolves plugin ownership from the skill path, rejects mismatched plugin metadata, and builds loaded metadata from the current `SKILL.md` frontmatter.
- CLI and system packages belong in `plugin.yaml` `runtime-dependencies`.
- Postinstall/bootstrap commands belong in `plugin.yaml` `runtime-postinstall`.
- MCP endpoints and allowed tool surfaces belong in `plugin.yaml` `mcp`.
- CLI env placeholders and deployment defaults belong in `plugin.yaml` `command-env`.
- OAuth and static credential env names belong in `plugin.yaml` `oauth` and `credentials`.
- Skill text may diagnose missing runtime surfaces, but must not tell the agent to install packages, run installer scripts, configure API keys, or repair sandbox package installation from inside a user workflow.

### Security goals

- Secrets are hidden from the model and sandbox filesystem.
- Credentials are requester-bound.
- Leases are valid only for the active turn.
- Provider defaults may guide command construction, but credential availability is still provider-level and turn-bound.

## GitHub profile

### Permission model

- Plugin manifest capabilities map to GitHub App installation permissions.
- Runtime requests the full permission set declared by the GitHub plugin manifest.
- Repo context is still important for command correctness, but credential issuance is provider-level and turn-bound.

### Lease behavior

- Header transforms target `api.github.com`.
- If repo contents access is declared, runtime also injects auth for `github.com` git smart-HTTP.
- Runtime cache may reuse a lease in memory for repeated GitHub commands in the same turn.

## Sentry profile

### Permission model

- The Sentry plugin currently declares a single host-side capability: `sentry.api`.
- Runtime still treats issuance as provider-level, not command-level.

### OAuth behavior

- `OAuthBearerBroker` checks for a per-user OAuth token stored by requester ID.
- If the token is near expiry, runtime refreshes it server-side.
- Missing or stale auth triggers the private OAuth resume flow defined in the OAuth Flows Spec.

## Observability

Emit events without secret material:

- `credential_issue_request`
- `credential_issue_success`
- `credential_issue_failed`
- `credential_inject_start`

## Non-goals

- Skill-level capability allowlists.
- Model-visible auth-management commands.
- Provider-specific policy engines beyond requester and turn scoping.
- Using arbitrary skill prose as an authority source for runtime package installation, MCP setup, command env, or credential configuration.

## Backward compatibility

- Plugin-backed skills must migrate off `requires-capabilities`.
- Authenticated provider work should run the real provider command and let the runtime handle auth implicitly.
