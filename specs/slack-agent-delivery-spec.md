## Changelog

- 2026-04-15: Initial canonical contract for Slack agent entry surfaces, reply delivery, continuation behavior, and convergence plan.
- 2026-04-16: Removed streamed Slack text from the primary delivery contract. Standardized on assistant status for in-flight progress plus finalized thread replies for visible output.
- 2026-04-16: Clarified that reply-text translation is owned by the shared Slack output module and direct outbound callers only deliver already-rendered Slack text.
- 2026-04-16: Clarified that Chat SDK Slack `thread.channelId` values are adapter-scoped (`slack:<channel>`) and must be normalized before assistant status/title API calls.
- 2026-04-16: Corrected the assistant-thread context rule to match Slack adapter behavior: non-DM message events use `channel + (thread_ts ?? ts)`, `message.im` uses `channel + thread_ts`, lifecycle events use `assistant_thread.channel_id + assistant_thread.thread_ts`, and runtime code does not synthesize DM roots from persisted state or generic message `ts`.
- 2026-04-16: Labeled long-running assistant status behavior as Slack-required behavior versus Junior runtime policy versus product policy.
- 2026-04-16: Added an optional finalized-reply footer contract for Slack context-block metadata.
- 2026-04-19: Removed stale references to typed status kinds and documented explicit progress as free-form rendered text.
- 2026-04-20: Strengthened the tool-backed progress policy to require early explicit progress for non-trivial turns and documented concrete phase-label guidance.
- 2026-04-20: Clarified that only explicit `reportProgress` updates replace generic loading messages; ordinary tool calls must not synthesize progress phases.
- 2026-04-22: Updated finalized reply footer metadata examples to reflect the displayed thinking-level bucket instead of the active trace ID.
- 2026-04-22: Required explicit progress messages to be written as proper sentence fragments (capitalized first letter, present-participle verb).
- 2026-04-22: Reframed auth-blocked requests as completed thread replies plus thread-local pending-auth state, and removed the public OAuth "connected, continuing..." preamble from automatic resumes.
- 2026-05-06: Removed the public thread-visible auth-pause note; private auth-link delivery is the only immediate user-facing auth handoff before callback resume.
- 2026-05-13: Added the turn-continuation acknowledgement and follow-up retry contract for awaiting continuation checkpoints.
- 2026-05-16: Added automatic processing reactions for Slack messages Junior is handling or evaluating for handling.
- 2026-05-19: Restored the visible URL-free auth-pause thread acknowledgement and required processing reaction restoration during auth resumes.

## Status

Active

## Purpose

Define the canonical user-visible Slack agent delivery contract for Junior:

- which Slack surfaces start or continue work
- how Junior builds and delivers replies in threads
- how assistant status, continuation posts, files, images, and resumed turns behave
- which Slack APIs are part of the product contract versus optional transport details

This spec exists so Slack behavior is described in one place instead of being inferred from runtime code, resume handlers, and tests independently.

## Scope

- DM, channel mention, subscribed-thread, and assistant-thread entry surfaces
- Thread context sourcing and image-hydration expectations relevant to delivery
- Long-running Slack UX: assistant status, finalized replies, continuation posts, files
- Resume and OAuth callback delivery behavior for paused Slack turns
- Verification shape for behavior tests versus Slack transport-contract tests

## Non-Goals

- Replacing the chat architecture contract in `chat-architecture-spec.md`
- Re-specifying OAuth token security or MCP credential handling
- Defining conversational quality criteria that belong to evals
- Making Slack-native text streaming part of Junior's correctness contract

## Contracts

### 1. Entry Surfaces

Junior currently supports four Slack entry paths:

1. Direct messages route through the explicit-mention path and must always be treated as reply-eligible.
2. Channel or thread `@mentions` route through the explicit-mention path.
3. Subscribed-thread follow-ups route through the subscribed-message path and may reply or stay silent based on the subscribed-thread policy.
4. Slack assistant lifecycle events (`assistant_thread_started`, `assistant_thread_context_changed`) initialize or refresh assistant-thread metadata and context.

Implications:

- DM traffic must not be silently treated like passive subscribed-thread traffic.
- Explicit mentions bypass passive no-reply classification.
- Assistant-thread lifecycle handling is part of the production surface even when the main conversational UX still happens in normal threads.

### 2. Context Sourcing Contract

Junior must prefer persisted local thread state over refetching Slack thread history on every turn.

Current contract:

1. Seed thread conversation state once from the available thread history (`thread.messages` or recent thread messages) when local conversation state is empty.
2. Persist normalized user and assistant messages into thread conversation state as the canonical ongoing context.
3. Rebuild per-turn prompt context from persisted conversation state, not from ad-hoc Slack history fetches.
4. Preserve attachment/image context across ingress and skipped-thread paths so later turns can still reason about earlier screenshots or uploaded images.
5. For Slack assistant status/title updates, Junior must use Slack's live assistant-thread identifiers from the current event: non-DM message events use `channel` + (`thread_ts` when present, otherwise the live message `ts` for the first thread reply), `message.im` uses `channel` + explicit `thread_ts`, and lifecycle events use `assistant_thread.channel_id` + `assistant_thread.thread_ts`. Junior must not synthesize assistant-thread roots from persisted state, and it must not substitute DM roots from a generic message `ts`.

This contract is intentional because Slack thread-history fetches are not a stable per-turn dependency for modern agent behavior, especially given Slack's newer `conversations.replies` limits for some app classes.

### 3. Assistant-Thread Lifecycle Contract

When Slack starts an assistant thread, Junior must:

1. Set an assistant thread title.
2. Set suggested prompts.
3. Persist assistant-context channel information when Slack provides source-channel context.
4. Normalize Chat SDK Slack channel identifiers before calling Slack assistant-thread APIs. `thread.channelId` is adapter-scoped (`slack:<channel>`), while Slack's `assistant.threads.*` methods require the raw conversation ID (`C...` / `D...`).
5. `assistant_thread_context_changed` refreshes assistant context and prompts, but it must not reset an already established conversation title back to a generic default.
6. When Junior updates a DM/app-thread title to something conversation-specific, it must generate that title from the earliest human message Junior actually knows about for the thread, using the lightweight title model. Do not derive the title from a later follow-up or from assistant reply text.
7. Title generation may run in parallel with the main assistant turn, but it must not delay assistant reply generation or visible reply delivery.

This lifecycle path currently enriches the assistant container but does not replace the main thread-based reply contract.

### 4. Long-Running Status Contract

Junior must surface progress during long-running turns before final reply delivery.

Current contract:

1. Start a non-empty assistant status early in the turn.
2. Debounce rapid status changes.
3. Refresh non-empty status before Slack clears it automatically.
4. Clear the status explicitly when the turn stops.
5. Treat status updates as best effort. Status-update failures are observable but do not by themselves fail the turn.
6. Normalize Chat SDK Slack channel identifiers before `assistant.threads.setStatus`. Runtime code must not pass adapter-scoped `slack:<channel>` values through to Slack.
7. Slack `assistant.threads.*` calls must use the current inbound event's live assistant-thread key. For non-DM message events, the first reply may target `thread_ts ?? ts` from the live event. For `message.im`, an explicit `thread_ts` is still required; when Slack omits it, Junior skips assistant status/title updates instead of substituting the message `ts` or a stored root.
8. Status transports that debounce, rotate, or otherwise defer updates must bind the active Slack bot token when the turn starts instead of relying on later ambient request context. Delayed status updates must keep targeting the same workspace installation as the turn's final reply.
9. Assistant status is best effort and must not sit on the critical path for model/tool execution. Starting a turn or updating mid-turn status may queue Slack writes, but must not wait for Slack round-trips before assistant work continues.
10. When Junior has an explicit `reportProgress` update, it must replace the generic `loading_messages` rotation for that status update. Explicit progress owns the loading surface until another status update replaces it or the turn ends.
11. While a turn is active, Junior uses a stable generic `status` string for Slack's assistant loading state and changes the user-visible progress copy through `loading_messages`.
12. Final reply footer metadata is not part of the in-flight loading contract. Footer blocks, when present, belong only to the finalized reply artifact.

Status is the only in-flight progress surface required by the contract. Visible assistant reply text is posted only after the turn result is finalized and delivery has been planned.

Design note:

1. Slack-required behavior:
   - `assistant.threads.setStatus` uses the live `channel_id` + `thread_ts`.
   - Slack clears assistant status automatically when a reply arrives, or after its timeout if no reply arrives.
   - An empty status explicitly clears the indicator.
   - `loading_messages` is a Slack-owned optional field and, when used, must remain within Slack's documented limits.
2. Junior runtime policy:
   - Status writes are best effort and never block model/tool execution.
   - Deferred status writes are ordered so a late in-flight update cannot land after the turn already cleared status.
   - Long-running turns refresh the current status before Slack's timeout would remove it.
   - Delayed callbacks bind the active installation token when the turn starts.
3. Product policy:
   - Junior keeps Slack's `status` text stable and generic while a turn is active.
   - Junior may debounce and minimum-display-time status transitions to avoid unreadable flicker.
   - Junior may supply generic `loading_messages` from core bot configuration and randomize their order per turn.
   - Junior suppresses the generic `loading_messages` rotation while an explicit `reportProgress` update is active and uses the current progress message as the loading surface instead.
   - Junior exposes an internal `reportProgress` tool for sparse explicit progress messages.
   - For every non-trivial turn, the assistant should call `reportProgress` early with the initial major work phase and again only when the major phase meaningfully changes.
   - Trivial turns may rely on the generic loading state and do not need explicit progress.
   - Explicit progress messages should use concrete phase labels such as searching, reading, reviewing, or running checks rather than generic filler, and must be written as proper sentence fragments with a capitalized first letter and a present-participle verb (e.g. "Researching foo bar", not "researching foo bar").
   - Ordinary tool calls must not synthesize progress phases or override the generic loading-message rotation.
   - Footer metadata, when enabled, is a separate finalized-reply affordance and must not be treated as assistant progress.

### 5. Processing Reaction Contract

Junior must acknowledge Slack messages it is handling, or evaluating for handling, with an automatic processing reaction.

Current rules:

1. DM, explicit-mention, and subscribed-thread message handlers add `:eyes:` before turn preparation, passive reply classification, or assistant execution.
2. Junior removes that automatic `:eyes:` reaction when the handler completes, including reply, skip, opt-out, auth-pause, timeout-continuation, and fallback-error paths.
3. When an OAuth/MCP callback resumes an auth-paused request, Junior re-adds `:eyes:` to the original triggering Slack message while resumed processing runs, then removes it when the resumed handler completes.
4. Processing-reaction add and remove calls are best effort. Failures are observable but must not fail the turn or change reply routing.
5. The automatic processing reaction is runtime-owned. It must not be exposed as model progress, and it must not count as a successful user-requested reaction tool call.
6. If the assistant explicitly uses the Slack reaction tool to add `:eyes:` to the same inbound message, Junior leaves the reaction in place instead of removing the automatic acknowledgement.

### 6. Primary Reply Contract

Junior has one primary visible reply surface per turn: finalized Slack thread replies.

Current rules:

1. Do not create a visible Slack text artifact until the assistant reply is final enough to budget, normalize, and persist.
2. Deliver visible reply text through finalized thread posts, not through incremental text streaming.
3. Only mark a turn successful after the final visible Slack reply has been accepted by Slack.
4. If explicit user intent requested an in-channel post and that post already satisfied the request, Junior may suppress the thread text reply according to the reply-delivery plan.
5. Persisted assistant conversation state must reflect the same finalized reply content the user saw, not provisional pre-tool text.
6. Reply text must be rendered through the shared Slack output translator before delivery; raw Slack API writers do not own markdown translation rules.
7. When Junior adds reply footer metadata, it attaches that metadata as a Slack `context` block on the final text chunk only, while keeping the main reply text as the top-level fallback.
8. Footer metadata is derived from structured reply diagnostics and correlation state. Conversation ID, selected thinking level, token totals, and turn duration may be shown when available; footer rendering must not scrape logs or spans after the fact.
9. Footer metadata is not an assistant-status surface and must not be used to convey in-flight progress.

This is intentional. Slack-native text streaming may still exist as an adapter capability, but it is not part of Junior's correctness contract.

### 7. Continuation Contract

Slack continuation posts are part of the user-visible delivery contract.

Current rules:

1. A single inline Slack reply is capped by the repository reply budget (`2200` chars, `45` lines).
2. If a finalized reply exceeds that budget, Junior splits it into multiple thread messages.
3. When a finalized reply needs more than two messages, every non-final overflow chunk ends with `[Continued below]`.
4. When a finalized reply needs exactly two messages, Junior omits `[Continued below]` because Slack thread ordering already makes the continuation obvious.
5. The final chunk does not carry `[Continued below]`.
6. If a visible reply ended because the provider failed mid-turn, the final visible chunk ends with `[Response interrupted before completion]`.
7. Continuation markers are delivery-time formatting, not model-authored text.

### 8. Code Fence Continuation Contract

Continuation behavior must preserve readable fenced markdown/code in Slack.

Current rules:

1. If a chunk boundary lands inside an open fenced code block, Junior closes the fence before appending `[Continued below]`.
2. The next chunk reopens the fence before continuing the remaining content.

This is required for readable Slack rendering, not an optional formatting nicety.

### 9. File Delivery Contract

Files are part of the same finalized reply-delivery plan as text.

Current rules:

1. Thread replies attach files inline on the first visible reply post when possible.
2. File-only replies must still create a visible Slack thread reply carrying the file payload.
3. If thread text is intentionally suppressed, files may still be delivered through the thread reply planner when the reply contract requires visible artifacts.
4. Resume and OAuth callback flows must use the same file-delivery semantics as the main runtime path.

### 10. Image Ingress Contract

Images passed into Slack threads are part of the thread context contract.

Current rules:

1. Slack file/image attachments on inbound messages must survive ingress normalization, including `message_changed` events.
2. Private-file fetchers must be rehydrated before runtime processing whenever messages are deserialized or side-channeled through webhook handlers.
3. Passive subscribed-thread messages that include potential image attachments must not be permanently marked as already hydrated before image hydration has actually run.
4. Later explicit mentions in the same thread may rely on previously skipped screenshots or image uploads still being recoverable from persisted conversation state.
5. If Slack delivered an image attachment but the current Junior runtime cannot analyze images, replies must say that the image was received but cannot be analyzed; they must not claim that no image was attached.

### 11. Resume Delivery Contract

Paused turns resumed by timeout or OAuth must follow the same final Slack delivery contract as live turns.

Current rules:

1. Resume handlers generate the final reply under the normal thread lock.
2. Resume handlers use the shared Slack reply planner for text chunking, continuation markers, interruption markers, and file delivery.
3. Resume success is defined by final visible Slack delivery, not only by successful assistant generation.
4. Persisted thread state is updated only after the final reply has been delivered to Slack.
5. Because live turns do not publish provisional assistant text, timeout continuation remains eligible until final reply delivery starts.
6. When a turn blocks on OAuth/MCP auth, Junior must privately deliver the auth link, post a brief visible thread acknowledgement that authorization is needed, clear `activeTurnId`, and persist thread-local pending-auth state. The visible acknowledgement must not include the auth URL or other secret-bearing state.
7. Automatic auth resumes must not post a separate public "account connected, continuing..." banner before the real resumed answer. The resumed answer itself is the visible continuation.
8. If auth completes after a newer thread message already superseded the blocked request, Junior stores the credentials but does not post a stale resumed answer.
9. When a turn checkpoint is scheduled for automatic continuation, Junior must post a durable thread acknowledgement that the turn is continuing in the background. Assistant status alone is not sufficient because it is best effort and expires independently of thread history.
10. If a user follow-up or duplicate delivery hits the same awaiting continuation, Junior should acknowledge the existing continuation instead of creating a second visible turn. Checkpoint rescheduling mechanics belong to `./agent-session-resumability-spec.md`.
11. Turn-continuation acknowledgements are not final assistant replies. They do not mark the original turn completed, and the final resumed answer must still be delivered through the normal finalized-reply path.

### 12. Testing Contract

Slack integration coverage must be behavior-first while still protecting real Slack transport contracts.

Required split:

1. Behavior integration tests cover scenario-readable runtime outcomes.
2. Slack transport-contract integration tests cover request shape, recipient metadata, and other external Slack API details when those details are the contract.
3. Transport-contract assertions must live in dedicated contract-oriented tests or clearly named suites, not dominate general behavior test files.
4. Evals cover conversational outcomes and realistic prompts, not low-level Slack request mechanics.

## Failure Model

1. Slack status-update failures are best effort and must not by themselves fail the turn.
2. Slack thread-post or final delivery failures are turn failures because the visible reply contract was not satisfied.
3. Junior must not persist assistant conversation state for a turn until final Slack delivery succeeds.
4. If a reply normalizes to empty and no files exist, Junior must post an explicit fallback message rather than silently succeeding.
5. If a chunked reply overflows a code fence boundary, fence integrity must still be preserved in the delivered Slack posts.

## Observability

Slack delivery behavior must emit enough diagnostics to distinguish:

- reply planning from post failure
- best-effort status failures from reply failures
- skipped subscribed-thread replies from delivery bugs
- resume delivery failures from generation failures

Representative event names already in use include:

- `slack_thread_post_failed`
- `assistant_status_update_failed`
- `subscribed_message_reply_skipped`
- `timeout_resume_failed`

Required attribute families remain governed by the logging specs, especially messaging/thread identifiers and AI turn/session context.

## Verification

Required verification coverage for this contract:

1. Integration: DM, mention, and subscribed-thread routing outcomes.
2. Integration: long-running status plus finalized primary reply behavior.
3. Integration: continuation overflow, interruption markers, and code-fence preservation.
4. Integration: file-only replies, suppressed-thread-text file delivery, and resume-path file parity.
5. Integration: image attachments surviving edited-message ingress and skipped passive-thread hydration.
6. Integration: assistant-thread lifecycle metadata initialization.
7. Evals: realistic user-visible multi-turn Slack behaviors when model interpretation is part of the contract.

## Convergence Plan

This section is non-normative. It describes the intended cleanup sequence without changing the current contract above.

### Phase 1: Lock the Finalized-Reply Contract

1. Keep the shared Slack reply planner as the only authority for continuation markers, file delivery, and resumed post planning.
2. Keep persisted thread conversation state as the primary context source.
3. Keep the explicit separation between behavior integration tests and Slack transport-contract tests.

Exit criteria:

- No alternate resume-only or ingress-only reply formatting path remains.
- Canonical specs and behavior tests describe the same continuation/file semantics.

### Phase 2: Improve Progress Without Reintroducing Text Streaming Coupling

1. Keep assistant status as the baseline progress affordance.
2. If richer progress is needed later, prefer status/task-oriented surfaces over provisional assistant prose.
3. Keep visible answer text tied to finalized reply delivery, not mid-generation transport state.

Exit criteria:

- Assistant-thread and long-running channel-thread experiences both surface observable progress without requiring provisional thread text.

### Phase 3: Keep Adapter Dependencies on the Public Surface

1. Prefer documented adapter and Slack API surfaces over monkey-patching private adapter internals.
2. Keep reply correctness independent from optional adapter-level streaming behavior.

Exit criteria:

- A Slack adapter upgrade failure is caught at a narrow boundary instead of breaking reply delivery deep in production flow.
