# Task Execution Spec

## Metadata

- Created: 2026-06-01
- Last Edited: 2026-06-02

## Purpose

Define Junior's durable execution contract for serverless runtimes where any
function invocation may disappear, time out around 300 seconds, or receive
duplicate queue deliveries.

The system exists so inbound work is not lost, active conversations recover
without user pings, and long agent loops can continue across fresh serverless
invocations without turning every tool call into a queue round trip.

## Scope

- Durable conversation mailboxes for inbound work.
- Vercel Queue wake-up messages.
- Conversation-scoped leases and worker check-ins.
- Cooperative agent-loop yielding at safe Pi continuation boundaries.
- Heartbeat repair for expired leases and stranded mailbox work.
- The boundary between Slack-specific ingress and generic agent execution.
- First-pass migration away from Chat SDK queue, lock, and long-running handler
  ownership.

## Non-Goals

- A generic workflow engine.
- A durable task database with task records, checkpoint references, child task
  state machines, or slice counters.
- Queueing every model call or every tool call as a separate asynchronous task.
- Exactly-once external side-effect delivery.
- Mid-model-stream or mid-tool-call checkpointing.
- Owning model-execution poison-work policy. Timeout slice caps belong to
  `./agent-session-resumability.md`; this layer only requeues or releases
  conversation work based on durable runnable state.
- Using Slack thread messages as progress filler for routine continuation.

## Contracts

### Architecture Summary

Junior uses a durable conversation mailbox plus a queue wake-up nudge.

  P -->|no| K
```

Normative rules:

1. Durable mailbox state is the source of truth for pending inbound work.
2. Vercel Queue messages are wake-up nudges only. Their payload is
   `{ conversationId }`.
3. Queue delivery is at-least-once. Duplicate nudges must be cheap and safe.
4. A worker may execute a conversation only while holding the conversation
   lease.
5. The agent session log is the checkpoint. No task payload should name a
   checkpoint or resume position.
6. Continuation means loading the latest durable conversation/session state and
   calling Pi `continue()`.
7. Routine continuation must be silent in Slack. The agent-owned
   `reportProgress` path and assistant status own user-visible progress.

### Identity Model

`conversationId` is the execution key. For Slack, it must be a stable normalized
thread identity such as `slack:<channel_id>:<thread_ts>`.

`inboundMessageId` is the idempotency key for one normalized inbound message.
For Slack, it should be derived from the Slack team, channel, message timestamp,
event subtype/edit identity when relevant, and source event id when available.

`leaseToken` is a random value proving that the current worker owns the
conversation lease.

There is no durable task id in the first-pass design.

### Ingress Contract

Inbound source handlers are source-specific. Slack parsing, signature
verification, event subtype handling, assistant lifecycle event handling, and
attachment normalization may be Slack-specific.

Ingress must not decide whether an inbound message is a new turn, steering for
an active turn, or a stale follow-up. It always performs the same durable handoff:

1. Verify the source request.
2. Normalize a stable `conversationId` and `inboundMessageId`.
3. Persist the inbound message into the conversation mailbox idempotently.
4. Enqueue `{ conversationId }`.
5. Return the source HTTP acknowledgement quickly.

The source HTTP acknowledgement is not the late acknowledgement. Late
acknowledgement applies to the queue delivery consumed by the worker.

If enqueue fails after mailbox append, the heartbeat repair path must later
find the stranded pending mailbox work and enqueue another nudge.

### Mailbox Contract

The mailbox is conversation-owned durable state. Implementations may store it as
one record, indexed inbound message records, or both. The contract is:

- inbound messages are deduped by `inboundMessageId`
- pending messages are ordered by source creation time and stable tie-breakers
- a pending message is not removed or marked injected until the corresponding
  session-log append succeeds
- reinjecting the same `inboundMessageId` into the session log must be
  idempotent
- messages that arrive while a worker is active remain pending until the worker
  drains them at a safe boundary or a later worker resumes the conversation

Conceptual shape:

```ts
interface InboundMessageRecord {
  inboundMessageId: string;
  conversationId: string;
  source: "slack" | "scheduler" | "plugin";
  createdAtMs: number;
  receivedAtMs: number;
  input: AgentInputMessage;
  injectedAtMs?: number;
}

interface ConversationWorkState {
  conversationId: string;
  lease?: ConversationLease;
  lastEnqueuedAtMs?: number;
  updatedAtMs: number;
}
```

The exact storage shape should stay simple. Do not add a separate task record
only to represent data already present in the mailbox or session log.

### Queue Contract

The first implementation should use Vercel Queues push consumers if Vercel
Queues satisfies these requirements:

- at-least-once delivery
- consumer-controlled acknowledgement after handler completion
- redelivery when the consumer dies before acknowledgement
- visibility timeout or auto-extension suitable for serverless handlers
- idempotent send using a stable key when available

The queue message payload is:

```ts
interface ConversationQueueMessage {
  conversationId: string;
}
```

Queue consumer rules:

1. Load durable conversation work state before doing agent work.
2. If there is no pending or resumable work, acknowledge the queue delivery and
   exit.
3. If another worker holds an unexpired lease, enqueue a delayed nudge for the
   same `conversationId`, acknowledge the current delivery, and exit.
4. If the lease is absent or expired, acquire a new lease and process.
5. Acknowledge the queue delivery only after durable state is safe: final
   delivery recorded, lease released after cooperative yield, no work found, or
   unrecoverable failure recorded.

The queue is not the state authority. A successful queue acknowledgement only
means that one wake-up delivery has been handled.

Queue idempotency keys must be scoped to the source of one wake-up attempt:
the inbound message id, worker nudge timestamp, or heartbeat scan timestamp.
They must not be stable only by `conversationId` and reason, because that can
suppress a later legitimate recovery or continuation nudge inside the queue
provider's idempotency window.

The Vercel push consumer boundary is a thin adapter around the generic worker:
it validates the `{ conversationId }` payload, uses `handleCallback`, and keeps
the Vercel visibility timeout slightly beyond the configured function timeout
so redelivery does not race host teardown at the exact timeout boundary. The
internal push endpoint is `/api/internal/agent/continue`, because each queue
delivery asks Junior to continue the latest durable agent state for that
conversation. The app must wire the concrete conversation runner before
registering the queue trigger; otherwise queue messages could be acknowledged
without advancing agent state.

### Lease And Check-In Contract

The conversation lease serializes execution for one `conversationId`.

Lease acquisition requires:

- no current lease, or
- current `leaseExpiresAtMs <= now`

Lease writes must include a fresh `leaseToken`. Any leased mutation must verify
that the stored token still matches the worker token.

Initial timing defaults:

```text
worker check-in interval: 15s
lease ttl: 90s
heartbeat scan interval: 30s
recovery trigger: leaseExpiresAtMs <= now
```

Check-ins are owned by the generic worker, not by agent progress events. While a
worker is leased, it periodically extends `leaseExpiresAtMs` and updates
`lastCheckInAtMs`. Agent progress events may update status or diagnostics, but
they are not required for lease liveness.

There is one liveness rule: expired lease. `lastCheckInAtMs` is diagnostic
metadata.

### Worker Contract

A worker that owns the lease advances the conversation:

1. Start the lease check-in timer.
2. Drain pending mailbox messages into the agent session log.
3. Restore Pi state from the reduced session log.
4. Call `continue()`.
5. At each safe boundary, drain newly pending mailbox messages into the same
   active conversation before another model call starts.
6. If cooperative yield is due, enqueue `{ conversationId }`, release the lease,
   acknowledge the queue delivery, and exit.
7. If the agent is final, drain the mailbox one last time before delivery. If new
   messages were pending, continue instead of posting a stale answer.
8. Deliver the finalized reply through the destination delivery port.
9. Persist completion state, release the lease, and acknowledge the queue
   delivery.

Inbound messages that arrive during an active run are part of the active
conversation. They are injected at the next safe boundary, not treated as a
separate concurrent turn.

### Cooperative Yield Contract

Cooperative yielding prevents long agent loops from running into serverless
timeouts without queueing every tool call.

Target timing for a 300 second function cap:

```text
soft yield deadline: 240s from worker start
minimum budget before starting another model-loop iteration: 120s
checkpoint/requeue buffer: 60s
```

The worker checks yield eligibility only at safe boundaries:

- before the first model call, if setup somehow consumed too much budget
- after a complete model response and its requested tool batch have finished
- after tool results have been durably appended to the session log
- after provider retry cleanup from a safe Pi boundary
- after auth pause state has been durably recorded
- before final reply delivery, after the final inbox drain

Unsafe yield points:

- midway through a model stream
- after an assistant tool request but before tool execution has produced durable
  results
- midway through a tool call
- after final Slack delivery has started but before completion state is
  persisted

If the soft deadline passes during a model or tool call, the worker does not
invent a checkpoint or force an emergency abort. Correctness relies on the
latest durable session-log boundary, queue redelivery, and heartbeat recovery.

When yielding, the worker:

1. Ensures all safe-boundary session-log writes are complete.
2. Enqueues `{ conversationId }`.
3. Releases the lease.
4. Acknowledges the queue delivery.
5. Exits without posting a routine continuation message to Slack.

### Agent Runtime Boundary

The agent runtime should remain transport-agnostic. Slack-specific ingress may
normalize Slack events, but after mailbox injection the runtime consumes generic
agent input messages and generic delivery ports.

Required ports are intentionally small:

- load/drain inbound messages for a conversation
- append injected messages to the agent session log
- restore Pi state and call `continue()`
- update best-effort progress/status
- deliver the finalized reply

The new implementation must not rely on Chat SDK for queueing, concurrency
locks, long-running handler lifetime, or conversation work recovery. Any
transitional compatibility wrapper must be treated as non-canonical and must not
own execution semantics.

### Slack Delivery Contract

Slack remains one delivery implementation.

Rules specific to the mailbox worker:

1. Slack HTTP ingress returns quickly after durable mailbox append and enqueue.
2. Assistant status should continue across cooperative yields by persisting the
   latest progress/status state and re-establishing it when a later worker
   resumes.
3. Routine cooperative yields must not post automatic "continuing in the
   background" thread messages.
4. `reportProgress` and assistant status are the progress surface for long work.
5. Final visible replies still use the finalized Slack reply planner and are
   delivered only after the agent has stopped and the inbox has been drained.
6. Slack delivery remains best effort around process death. First pass does not
   add a generalized receipt or reconciliation system beyond persisted
   conversation completion state.

### Heartbeat Contract

Heartbeat is a repair loop, not a worker.

On each bounded scan, heartbeat must:

1. Find conversations with expired leases.
2. Clear or replace the expired lease state.
3. Enqueue `{ conversationId }`.
4. Find conversations with pending mailbox messages, no unexpired lease, and no
   recent enqueue marker.
5. Enqueue `{ conversationId }` for those stranded conversations.

Heartbeat must not run the agent inline. It only repairs durable state and sends
queue wake-up nudges.

Heartbeat scans must be bounded by limits so one large backlog does not exhaust
the cron invocation. Remaining work is left for later heartbeats.

### Scheduler And Plugin Dispatch

Scheduler and trusted plugin work should enter the same execution system by
creating or selecting a conversation identity, appending a normalized agent input
message to the mailbox, and enqueueing `{ conversationId }`.

Source-specific scheduling, due-run claims, plugin idempotency, and destination
selection remain owned by their domain specs. Once claimed, execution should use
the same mailbox, lease, session-log, and delivery contracts as interactive
work.

### TODO Guardrails

The first pass intentionally avoids extra looping controls. After the mailbox
worker is proven in production, add policy for:

- maximum wall-clock age for one active conversation run
- maximum consecutive recoveries without a new session-log boundary
- explicit cancel/stop semantics for user messages that should abandon active
  work
- duplicate final-delivery suppression if duplicate replies are observed

These guardrails must not complicate the first-pass mailbox/lease design.

## Failure Model

1. Source request dies before mailbox append: no Junior work exists. The source
   platform may retry according to its own delivery contract.
2. Mailbox append succeeds but queue send fails: heartbeat finds pending mailbox
   work and enqueues a nudge.
3. Queue sends duplicate nudges: only one worker can hold the lease; duplicates
   acknowledge after observing no work or an active lease.
4. Queue delivery observes an active lease: it sends a delayed nudge and
   acknowledges so the message that arrived during active work is not stranded
   if the active worker misses the final drain.
5. Worker dies while leased: check-ins stop, `leaseExpiresAtMs` passes,
   heartbeat clears/requeues, and the next worker resumes from the latest
   durable session-log state.
6. Worker dies after appending inbound messages to the session log but before
   marking them injected: reinjection must be idempotent by `inboundMessageId`.
7. Worker dies during a model call or tool call: recovery resumes from the
   latest safe session-log boundary; no mid-call state is assumed durable.
8. Worker yields cooperatively and dies after enqueue but before queue
   acknowledgement: redelivery observes released lease or no unsafe work and
   remains harmless.
9. Worker dies after final delivery starts: Slack post and durable completion
   are not atomic. First pass accepts best-effort delivery semantics and does
   not add special reconciliation beyond persisted completion state.
10. Heartbeat misses one scan: Vercel Queue redelivery or the next heartbeat can
    still recover because leases and mailbox messages are durable.

## Observability

Required event names should distinguish normal progress from repair:

- `conversation_work_enqueued`
- `conversation_work_lease_acquired`
- `conversation_work_check_in_failed`
- `conversation_work_nudge_deferred_for_active_lease`
- `conversation_work_mailbox_drained`
- `conversation_work_cooperative_yield`
- `conversation_work_completed`
- `conversation_work_lease_expired_requeued`
- `conversation_work_pending_requeued`
- `conversation_work_failed`

Required attributes when available:

- `app.conversation.id`
- `app.conversation.source`
- `app.inbound.message_id`
- `app.inbound.pending_count`
- `app.queue.message_id`
- `app.queue.delivery_id`
- `app.lease.token_hash`
- `app.lease.expires_at_ms`
- `app.worker.elapsed_ms`
- `app.worker.soft_yield_deadline_ms`
- `app.worker.remaining_budget_ms`
- `gen_ai.request.model`
- `gen_ai.provider.name`

Logs and spans must not include raw Slack tokens, OAuth credentials, raw
authorization URLs, or unredacted private message bodies.

## Verification

Required invariants, using the lowest layer that proves the contract:

1. Component: mailbox append is idempotent by `inboundMessageId`.
2. Component: enqueue failure after mailbox append is repaired by heartbeat.
3. Component: duplicate queue nudges do not run a conversation concurrently.
4. Component: active-lease queue delivery defers a nudge and acknowledges.
5. Component: worker check-in extends the lease while a long model/tool call is
   in progress.
6. Component: expired leases and stranded pending mailbox messages are
   cleared/requeued by heartbeat.
7. Component: work requested while a lease is running is requeued immediately
   when the lease completes, even if no mailbox messages are pending.
8. Component: repeated worker and heartbeat requeues use fresh queue
   idempotency keys so provider dedupe cannot suppress later runnable work.
9. Component: messages that arrive during active execution are injected at the
   next safe boundary or requeued instead of being lost.
10. Component: final inbox drain prevents completing a stale answer when new work
    arrived before delivery.
11. Component: cooperative yield near the soft deadline releases the lease and
    enqueues another nudge.
12. Integration: Slack ingress returns after durable mailbox append and enqueue,
    not after agent execution.
13. Integration: a queue-driven Slack worker path reaches the real Slack runtime
    and finalized delivery with deterministic fake-agent output.
14. Component/integration: recovery after death during model/tool work resumes
    from the latest durable session-log boundary.
15. Evals: realistic multi-message Slack follow-ups during long work are folded
    into the active answer without losing user intent.
