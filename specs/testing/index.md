## Changelog

- 2026-05-27: Added fail-closed external HTTP isolation for tests/evals with explicit local, model, and sandbox control-plane exceptions.
- 2026-04-21: Replaced the old layer ordering with a simpler decision rule: integration by default for product/runtime changes, evals as the integration-style layer for agent behavior, unit only for local deterministic logic.
- 2026-03-03: Standardized metadata headers and reconciled spec references/structure.
- 2026-03-04: Updated test fixture path references to repo-root paths under `packages/junior/`.
- 2026-03-04: Clarified layering: baseline behavior coverage belongs in integration tests; unit tests are for local regressions and edge cases.
- 2026-03-04: Elevated layer selection to mandatory policy before adding/updating tests.
- 2026-03-17: Clarified that behavior tests should not assert internal logs or telemetry unless instrumentation is the contract under test.
- 2026-03-22: Defined the default layer preference order: evals first for LLM-dependent behavior, integration next for real wiring without the LLM, unit last for local invariants only.
- 2026-03-25: Banned prompt-prose substring assertions as a testing strategy; prompt wording changes must be validated through behavior contracts, not static string matching.
- 2026-04-15: Clarified that Slack transport-contract assertions remain integration tests but should live in dedicated contract-oriented suites instead of general behavior files.

## Purpose

This index defines the project testing taxonomy and the contract between test layers.
Use this file as the source of truth for where a test belongs and what it is allowed to mock.

## Default Decision Rule

Start from the real product contract, not the easiest seam to mock.

1. Use integration tests for most product/runtime changes: real wiring, handler behavior, Slack-facing contracts, persistence, routing, auth resumes, and other user-visible behavior that does not depend on the model interpreting language correctly.
2. Use evals when the contract is agent-facing behavior. Treat evals as the integration-style layer for prompt behavior, natural-language routing, continuity, reply quality, and other outcomes where model interpretation is the contract.
3. Use unit tests only for tightly local deterministic logic: parsing, scoring, routing heuristics, retry math, pure transforms, normalization, and similar algorithmic invariants.

Do not default to unit tests for runtime behavior just because they are easier to write.

## Test Layers

## Shared Rules Across All Layers

Layer selection is mandatory: classify the test contract first and choose `unit` vs `integration` vs `eval` before writing assertions.

1. Tests must be deterministic and isolated.
2. External HTTP is blocked by default in tests and evals; use MSW or the shared HTTP interceptor fixtures. Local URLs, model endpoints, and Vercel sandbox/OIDC control-plane traffic are the only live exceptions.
3. Slack network access is blocked in tests; use MSW fixtures for Slack HTTP.
4. Use centralized fixtures/factories (`packages/junior/tests/fixtures/slack/*`) over ad-hoc payload literals when available.
5. Prefer asserting user-visible behavior and external contracts over implementation details.
6. Keep test names descriptive of outcomes, not implementation mechanics.
7. Do not over-test: cover representative, high-risk scenarios for each contract, not every theoretical permutation.
8. Prefer one focused assertion path per behavior contract; add more cases only when they validate a distinct failure mode.
9. Workflow behavior integration tests should execute real runtime paths and only substitute deterministic fake agent output at the agent boundary.
10. Do not assert internal observability emission (`logInfo`, `logWarn`, spans, trace attributes) in behavior tests unless instrumentation output is itself the contract under test.
11. Do not assert prompt prose by checking that a string is present in a generated prompt. Prompt wording is not a stable contract; validate the resulting behavior in evals or integration tests instead.
12. If Slack API call shape or ordering is the external contract under test, keep those assertions in dedicated transport-contract integration suites; general behavior files should stay scenario-readable.
13. Prefer real in-memory adapters, fixtures, and harnesses over bespoke fake stores when the contract crosses module boundaries.

## Coverage Budget (Avoid Over-Testing)

Over-testing means adding low-signal tests that duplicate the same contract with different constants, mirror implementation branches without new behavior risk, or assert internal details that users do not observe.

This includes logger calls and trace metadata for ordinary behavior paths. Those assertions belong only in instrumentation-focused tests or surfaces where the emitted output is the product (for example CLI output).

Use this practical budget:

1. Happy path for the contract.
2. One high-likelihood failure mode (or policy guardrail).
3. One boundary scenario only when it has prior incident history or meaningful production risk.

If a proposed test does not add a new contract guarantee, do not add it.

## Layer Selection Guide

This section is mandatory policy, not guidance.

Ask these questions in order:

1. Does the contract depend on the model choosing the right behavior or producing the right reply quality?
   Use `eval`.
   Examples: natural-language routing, passive participation, multi-turn continuity, prompt/skill behavior, research-answer shape.
2. Otherwise, is this a product/runtime change with real wiring, Slack-visible behavior, persistence, auth resume, or API contract effects?
   Use `integration`.
   This is the default answer for most non-trivial product changes.
3. Otherwise, is the contract tightly local deterministic logic or an algorithmic invariant?
   Use `unit`.
   Examples: retry math, pure transforms, normalization, local scoring, parser behavior, deterministic state transitions.

If a test needs to mock large parts of the runtime just to prove a user-visible flow, that is usually evidence the test belongs in integration or eval instead.

## Mock Confidence Rules

These rules are mandatory whenever mocks or fakes appear in a test.

1. Mock one boundary, not a whole workflow.
2. The mocked boundary must be the thing the layer is explicitly allowed to replace.
3. If a test needs to fake persisted state, Slack delivery, and reply execution together to prove one user-visible outcome, move it to integration or eval.
4. If the same user-visible contract is already covered by a higher-fidelity integration or eval test, narrow the mocked test to a local invariant or delete it.
5. Prefer real memory-backed state and the shared Slack/MSW harness over ad-hoc `Map` stores when the behavior crosses handler/runtime boundaries.

## Current Audit Checklist

Use this list when touching adjacent suites. It records the main consolidation targets behind the policy update.

1. `packages/junior/tests/unit/handlers/oauth-callback.test.ts` and `packages/junior/tests/integration/oauth-callback-slack.test.ts`: keep HTML sanitization, token-exchange parameter shaping, and invalid-state branches in unit; keep app-home publication and thread-resume behavior in integration; remove duplicated resume-path assertions from the unit suite when those flows are touched next.
2. `packages/junior/tests/unit/handlers/mcp-oauth-callback.test.ts` and `packages/junior/tests/integration/mcp-oauth-callback-slack.test.ts`: keep callback sanitization and local omitted-image/state reconstruction invariants in unit; keep resumed-thread delivery, file uploads, and Slack-side continuation behavior in integration.
3. `packages/junior/tests/unit/handlers/turn-resume.test.ts` and `packages/junior/tests/integration/turn-resume-slack.test.ts`: keep auth rejection, timeout re-enqueue, and persistence-failure edge handling in unit; keep successful resumed delivery, exhausted-depth user messaging, and shared file-delivery path coverage in integration.
4. `packages/junior/tests/unit/slack/slack-runtime.test.ts` together with `packages/junior/tests/integration/slack/new-mention-behavior.test.ts` and `packages/junior/tests/integration/slack/subscribed-message-behavior.test.ts`: keep ordering, formatting, and local orchestration invariants in unit; keep scenario-level mention/subscribed-thread behavior in integration; split the unit file if scenario tests continue to grow.
5. `packages/junior/tests/integration/slack/subscribed-message-behavior.test.ts`, `packages/junior/tests/integration/slack/thread-continuity-behavior.test.ts`, `packages/junior-evals/evals/core/passive-behavior.eval.ts`, and `packages/junior-evals/evals/core/routing-and-continuity.eval.ts`: let integration own deterministic routing gates, subscription state, and Slack delivery contracts; let evals own ambiguous natural-language direction, passive-participation quality, and continuity recall; avoid duplicating the same human-language scenario in both layers.
6. `packages/junior/tests/integration/oauth-callback-slack.test.ts`, `packages/junior/tests/integration/mcp-oauth-callback-slack.test.ts`, and `packages/junior-evals/evals/core/oauth-workflows.eval.ts`: keep callback routing and Slack API effects in integration; keep user-visible continuation quality and context retention in evals; do not duplicate resume wiring assertions in evals.
7. `packages/junior/tests/unit/runtime/respond-mcp-progressive-loading.test.ts` and `packages/junior/tests/integration/mcp-auth-runtime-slack.test.ts`: keep the unit suite for local MCP auth-pause edge cases and checkpoint invariants; keep the integration suite for the real Slack runtime plus OAuth callback happy path using the fake agent boundary only.

## Enforcement

`pnpm --filter @sentry/junior run test:slack-boundary` enforces major boundary rules:

- Eval files cannot import Slack contract internals.
- Integration behavior tests cannot use runtime module mocks.

See `scripts/check-slack-test-boundary.mjs`.
